I’m Jordan Shirkman—a husband, dad, and writer living in Ljubljana, Slovenia. I help people move from chaos to clarity through thoughtful reflection and decisive action.

In a noisy, distracted world, I’m trying to build a life marked by presence, purpose, and truth that holds up under pressure.

When I face a challenge, I look for the pattern beneath the problem. I listen carefully, ask questions, and search for a path forward—one rooted in wisdom, not impulse. That same process shapes how I write, lead, parent, and grow.

I write to clarify my own thinking and share what I believe will help others. I want my beliefs tested, convictions refined, and habits practiced. A life worth living won’t be built by accident.

You’ll often find me lifting heavy things, spending time in nature, scribbling in a notebook, or chasing chords on the piano or guitar. But more than anything, I’m learning to be fully present with the people I love—and to live for what will still matter a hundred years from now.

I write about **pursuing wisdom, mastering the ordinary, and taking action**. This includes:  
- **[Following Jesus faithfully](/categories/theology/)** — living out biblical truth in everyday life  
- **[Leveraging the right tools](/categories/technology/)** — using technology that serves, not distracts  
- **[Building with purpose](/categories/methodology/)** — refining habits, systems, and mindsets that lead to lasting impact  

If you're searching for clarity, truth, and tools that hold up—welcome. You can subscribe by [email](https://jshirk.kit.com) so you don’t miss a post.
