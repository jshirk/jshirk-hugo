## What is this blog?

I think there’s an interesting intersection between technology, theology and methodology. I write about those things and how they collide.

I enjoy experimenting to find new tactics, tools, and techniques to do more that matters. I want to share this information so you can learn from my experience (and failures) and become more effective in what you do. This isn’t so much a get-rich-quick type of productivity, but more of a slightly-improve-slowly approach.

I write about Jesus ([theology]((/categories/theology/))), apps and services ([technology]((/categories/technology/))) and how to do things better ([methodology]((/categories/methodology/))).

## Who is this guy?



I’m a follower of Jesus, husband to the incomparable Niki, proud dad to five growing humans, and I work with [Cru](https://give.cru.org/0642948) in Ljubljana, Slovenia helping people discover who Jesus is and live in a way that will matter for eternity. I love helping people leverage all that God has given them.

I [tweet](http://twitter.com/jshirk) and blog because I like connecting with people and helping others grow in their faith and abilities. I like puns and I got one of my better ones made into a [shirt](https://www.flickr.com/photos/busyprinting/4227080733)). I traded my 22nd birthday for [clean water](http://mycharitywater.org/jshirk). I like Chemex coffee, budgets, reading, and reading while drinking coffee and budgeting.
