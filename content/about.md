I’m a follower of Jesus, husband, and dad, and I live in Ljubljana, Slovenia where I enjoy helping people discover who Jesus is and live in a way that will matter for eternity. I’m trying to faithfully **apply the ancient (yet incredibly relevant) teachings of Jesus to a modern world**. I love sharing what I’m learning—both to help others and to refine my own thinking.  

When I face a problem, I **analyze it from every angle, seeking God’s perspective, and don’t stop until I find a solution**. This shapes how I write, teach, and live.  

In my free time, I enjoy **lifting, hiking, reading, writing, and dabbling on the piano and guitar**. More than anything, I’m **working to be present with my wife and kids and live for the eternal instead of the ephemeral**.  

I write because I believe that **faith should be tested, practiced, and proven in real life**—not just talked about. Many have abandoned faith because they’ve only seen a **flimsy version of Christianity**, one that hasn’t been **applied thoroughly, tested rigorously, or practiced faithfully**.  

Ultimately, I want my life to **matter to God, to my family, and to the people around me**. And if I can help others **think more clearly, pursue wisdom, and live with intention along the way**—even better.  

I write about **pursuing wisdom, mastering the ordinary, and building a meaningful life**. This includes:  
- **[Following Jesus faithfully](/categories/theology/)**—what it truly means to live out biblical truth in everyday life. 
- **[Leveraging the right tools](/categories/technology/)**—how technology can serve us, not distract us, in living purposefully.  
- **[Doing things better](/categories/methodology/)**—refining habits, systems, and mindsets to be more effective and intentional.
