Do you love everything you do each day? I hope you do, but it’s unlikely.

Now, if you don’t love what you’re doing, why don’t you change it?

You’ve only got 24 hours to make things happen each day, so why waste your time doing something you’re not passionate about?

Is it because there’s an end in mind? If you hate school, do you suck it up because you think you need an education to get a “good” job (one that you might dislike even more than school, but that you go to because all the cool kids are doing it)? Or is it because someone told you the choice isn’t yours?

If you’re doing something for a reason you’re unsure of—**figure out why you’re doing it or simply give up.**

[Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.com/sg/) calls the point of deciding whether it’s worth pushing on our giving up the Dip.

It’s the point at the bottom of the valley. The point where you either push harder or give up. **It’s the point where the majority walks away, but those who push through achieve greatness.**

Make a decision today to fight through the Dip or give up on the one-way street with a dead end and find a new path to follow.

I can’t say it any more succinctly than Seth:

Quit the wrong stuff.  
Stick with the right stuff.  
Have the guts to do one or the other.

**Do what you love. Forget the rest.**

_Your thoughts: are you in a Dip worth fighting through or are you in a cul-de-sac that doesn’t lead anywhere?_
