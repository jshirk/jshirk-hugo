You know that feeling after your payment has been processed for an _<span style="color: #ff0000;">As Seen On TV</span>_ <span style="color: #ff0000;"></span>product that you can't get the money for shipping back on? You just got a box on your doorstep with a [Slap Chop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWRyj5cHIQA) that didn't change your life and you found out the billow pad they made your Snuggie out of gives you a rash?

It's deflating.

### Overhyped Advertising + Underdelivered Product Quality = Vows Against TV Products and Nightmares About Billy Mays.

In [ReWork](http://37signals.com/rework/) by the founders of [37 Signals](http://37signals.com) Jason Fried and David Hansson there is a blurb on being &#8220;At Home Good&#8221;. Essentially, it's the idea that a product that may not be as flashy as others when you first come across it, but after spending time with that product, you can't help but realize how remarkable it is.

When a product doesn't deliver and is just bought on the basis of sketchy marketing, it's simply in-media good. It seems good when the media presents it the first time around, but when it comes down to it, it's more smoke and mirrors than quality.

## Now apply this principal to people.

_Ask Yourself&#8230;_  
When someone meets you, do you wow them with a facade but fail to be genuine?  
Do you have an act, build yourself up, or put on a show that works on the surface?  
Now when they get home and think back to your encounter, are they still impressed or do they feel like you just berated like you're on the campaign trail?  
 **Are you connecting with people or are you marketing yourself as something else?**  
Are you engaging, being truly interested in others, or do you just seem like a good deal before someone walks away?  
Are you talking more than you should? Are you listening to what they have to say or just planning your next canned response?

Don't advertise. Don't project a false persona. Let your true personality shine through&#8211;imperfections and all. **Get vulnerable.** Be honest about your weaknesses. Be real with people.

**No one is looking for perfect packaging on the outside only to find an empty box upon further inspection.**

Be someone who makes people think when they get home, &#8220;There's more to that person than meets the eye.&#8221; **Walk the talk.**
