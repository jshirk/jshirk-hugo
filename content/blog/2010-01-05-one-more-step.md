After two and a half years of some heavy use and abuse, the battery on my Macbook is slowly but surely dying.

I called Apple to see if they could send me a replacement battery, as my computer is still under warranty, but the man on the other end of the line assured me my battery was no longer covered. He said I could order a replacement from their website online or I could look online somewhere else because he knew that Apple.com would be the most expensive.

And that was that.

I was disappointed, but a warranty is a warranty, right? He was just doing his job, and he gave me a nice tip on going somewhere else to get a battery.

But couldn’t he have done more for a loyal customer?

I had already gone online, registered my computer, set up an appointment, described my problem, and waited for him to call. And when the call was finished, I was right back where I started.

**What’s the point of offering a suggestion that forces me to jump through more hoops to solve the problem?** What if he would have ordered a replacement battery from a reliable third-party he knew, or at least pointed me in that direction, emailed me the link, or connected me to one of their representatives? I would have been elated. Instead, he sent me into the search alone, and without any more direction than I started with.

**When you’re in the business (or lifestyle) of helping people, are you just making suggestions, or are you truly serving?**

Are you offering help, but not making yourself readily available?  
Are you a “customer-focused” business that doesn’t have an email or phone number on a website?  
Are you asking a friend to sit with you, or are you physically pulling up a chair for them?  
Are you going out of your way, forgetting about the costs, and serving to the point that people call you crazy?

**Inconvenience yourself.  Go one more step. Step beyond what’s expected to shock someone in the best way possible.**
