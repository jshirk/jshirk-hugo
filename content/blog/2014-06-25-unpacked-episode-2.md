You probably wouldn’t attend a peace talk from Vladimir Putin or a read a financial advice blog by Bernie Madoff.

So why listen to a podcast from a technophile on being present and putting his phone down?

It’s a fair question. If nothing else, it’s an opportunity to learn from my shortcomings.

On the latest installment of [The Unpacked Podcast](http://unpacked.co) Niki and I chat about the challenges of living in a constantly connected digital world and what we do to (try to) remain present.

You can find the show on the [Unpacked site](http://unpacked.co) or [subscribe in iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-unpacked-podcast/id887182955?mt=2) or via [RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/UnpackedPodcast).
