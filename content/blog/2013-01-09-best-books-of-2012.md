Reading is one of my favorite ways to spend my free time. One of my least favorite things is making it partially through a book not worth finishing. Here are two handfuls of books worth finishing in 2013.

<!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?-->

**10. [More Than Enough by Dave Ramsey![Image](/static/images/More-than-Enough-Dave-Ramsey.jpeg)  
][1]** 

I'm a self-diagnosed Dave-oholic. The principles Dave teaches in his courses, books and radio program are spot on. This is one of his shorter books, but it's still chock full of lots of solid principles on money management. His philosophy, managing money God's way, will flip your financial world right-side up.

**9. [Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson](http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1357715795&sr=1-1&keywords=steve+jobs)**

Clocking in at 650+ pages, this monster will take some time to sift through. If you're an Apple lover, you'llenjoy hearing stories of how your favorite products came to be and cringe as you hear how Jobs manipulated people, viewed reality through a distorted lens and tyrannically refused anything less than perfection from everyone around him. His quotes on faith broke my heart, but it's a great picture inside the mind of a man whoÂ changed the world.

**8. [Knowledge of the Holy by A.W. Tozer![Image](/static/images/Screen-Shot-2013-01-13-at-12.00.05-PM.jpeg)](http://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Holy-Attributes-Meaning-Christian/dp/0060684127/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1357715812&sr=1-1&keywords=knowledge+of+the+holy)**

The shortest piece on the list, and the most bang for your buck. It amazed me how succinctly and precisely Tozer laid out God's attributes and clearly painted a picture of the invisible God. It stirred my love for the Lord big time.

**7. [The Finishers by Roger Hershey](http://www.amazon.com/The-Finishers-ebook/dp/B007S02NVY/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1357715844&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=the+finishers+roger+hershey)**

![Image](/static/images/Screen-Shot-2013-01-13-at-12.00.13-PM.jpeg) 

With every page, I felt like Roger was telling me story after story of how to walk with Jesus. It inspired me to live my life boldly for the Lord to do whatever it took to finish the great commission in this generation, and to live a life that was foolish apart from Christ.

**6. [What is the Mission of the Church? by Kevin DeYoung and Greg Gilbert](http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/7923/nm/What+Is+the+Mission+of+the+Church%3F%3A+Making+Sense+of+Social+Justice%2C+Shalom%2C+and+the+Great+Commission?utm_source=jshirkman&utm_medium=blogpartners)**

![Image](/static/images/mission-of-the-church-cover.jpeg) 

A wonderful introduction to what the Church (with a big C) is aiming for and how a church (with a little c) can carry out what Jesus has called us to. A well-researched and well-argued case for what God expects of His people.

**5. [The Explicit Gospel by Matt Chandler](http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/8263/nm/The+Explicit+Gospel?utm_source=jshirkman&utm_medium=blogpartners)**

![Image](/static/images/The-Explicit-Gospel-Matt-Chandler.jpeg) 

Chandler's voice comes through loud and clear, and it reads in some ways like you're listening to a book full of his sermons. I enjoy his humor and wit, but others have mentioned the book could be cut in half if he would have cut to the chase. The main message is something all Christians need to remember: don't take clearly spelling out the gospel for granted.

**4. [Surprised by Hope by N.T. Wright](http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/5528/nm/Surprised+by+Hope%3A+Rethinking+Heaven%2C+the+Resurrection%2C+and+the+Mission+of+the+Church?utm_source=jshirkman&utm_medium=blogpartners)**

![Image](/static/images/surprised_by_hope.jpeg) 

Wright is captivating. I couldn't wait to open up another book by him. Surprised by Hope is all about the resurrection and what that means for our lives. He'll remind you why Paul says the Christian faith hinges on the resurrection and assure you God is making all things new.

**3. [Living by the Book by Howard Hendricks](http://www.amazon.com/Living-By-Book-Workbook-Science/dp/0802495389/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1357715864&sr=1-2)**

![Image](/static/images/Living-by-the-Book-Hendricks.jpeg) 

Flat out the best book I've come across on studying the Bible. Dozens of different methods, opportunities to try them out on a number of suggested passages, and lots of acronyms and alliterations to help you remember them. A great resource to return to when you want to really dig into the Word.

**2. [Money, Possessions and Eternity by Randy Alcorn](http://www.amazon.com/Money-Possessions-Eternity-Randy-Alcorn/dp/0842353607/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1357715664&sr=8-2&keywords=money+possessions+and+eternity+by+randy+alcorn)**

![Image](/static/images/money_possessions_and_eternity-randy-alcorn1.jpeg) 

Nearly exhaustive on the topic of Christian stewardship&#8211;one of my favorite topics. Alcorn walks through everything from income to budgets to leaving inheritances. He will undoubtedly challenge some of your current thinking and convictions. He's unashamed in his approach and isn't afraid to lay out what he believes God expects of Christians. Challenging, invigorating and recommended for everyone who wants God to manage their pocket book.

**1. [Knowing God by J.I. Packer](http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/1857/nm/Knowing+God?utm_source=jshirkman&utm_medium=blogpartners)**

![Image](/static/images/Knowing-God-Packer.jpeg) 

Mind blowing. Packer so clearly and concisely makes a case for every chapter, and it's hard to walk away disagreeing with him because he's biblically backed up every word. The chapter on adoption into God's family is worth the price on its own. I'm fairly certain I drained an entire pen underlining this classic work. I can't believe I didn't read it sooner and I can't wait to revisit it again. Please, please read this, mediate on it, and let it expand your view of God.
