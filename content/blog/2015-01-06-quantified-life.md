I’m a data nerd. I love analyzing information, finding patterns, and seeing connections. But data for the sake of data isn’t valuable–it’s only meaningful if you apply that information to create change.

In 2015, I’m purusing a more quantified life. If I know what I’m doing–tracking fitness, food, habits, thought patterns, sleep, spending, accomplishments–I can evaluate how I’m doing in pursuing goals and how effectively systems I’ve put into place to achieve things is working.

In general, I prefer specific apps that perform a single function. Technically, I could keep track of all this information in Evernote, but after deleting hundreds of worthless notes in the past few days, I’ve opted for a different, better option. Each app does one (ok, maybe two) things exceptionally well, and I know exactly what I’m doing when I open it. [footnote]That means I don’t have the walk-up-to-the-refrigerator-and-forget-why-I’m-there feeling.[/footnote]

Here are a few things I’m tracking this year and how I’m doing it. <!--more-->

### Budgeting

YNAB

**If someone on a playground said, “If you love YNAB so much why don’t you marry it?” I’d be able to say “I’m happily married, thank you very little,” and potentially make a case for human-software marriages not being healthy or legal, but beyond those rebuttals, that bully would have a case.**

I love using YNAB. I’ve [waxed poetically about in the past](https://jshirk.com/blog/ynab), and it’s a great system for tracking money. This is, bar none, app I’ve made a regular habit of regularly using, so it’s a no brainer to keep moving forward. I love being able to [review](https://jshirk.com/blog/reflecting-on-2014/) my biggest purchases, our family’s biggest purchases, and how we’re doing in the saving, giving, and spending realms at a high-level and in serious detail.

### Exercise

#### [Fitocracy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fitocracy-exercise-log-online/id509253726?mt=8&at=11l4uNett) / [Fitbit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fitbit/id462638897?mt=8&at=11l4uNett) / [Pedometer++](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pedometer++/id712286167?mt=8&at=11l4uNett)

I’ve been tracking my workouts with Fitocracy for almost a year. It has a massive index of exercises you can choose from, and you can create your own workout routines and fire it up when you’re ready to track them. I don’t use the social features at all, and they are actually a bit annoying, but I appreciate the convenience of tracking workouts and acquiring points (essentially a gauge to see how tough your workout was).

I use a [Fitbit One](https://jshirk.com/blog/fitbit-review/) (a few generations old at this point) to track steps I’ve taken, but I also use the Pedometer++ app on my phone. Sometimes I have my Fitbit in my pocket, but not my phone, and other times vice versa. I think the Fitbit is more accurate, but I don’t always remember to pop it into my pocket. I have two systems for step-counting–I’m a bit overzealous here.

### Food

#### [MyFitnessPal](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calorie-counter-diet-tracker/id341232718?mt=8&at=11l4uNett)

After measuring the time spent using my phone (more on that later), food is a close second in priority. My wife makes it easy-ish for me to eat healthy–she’s constantly creating elaborate meal plans, using natural, whole foods, and making sure we’re not eating junk.

Our one weakness is that we’ve both been genetically bequethed sweet teeth. [footnote]Can you even use sweet tooth in the plural?[/footnote] If there was a Cookieholics Annonymous, I could be a founding member. I can’t just eat one cookie, I have to eat a dozen. There are some serious spiritual implications wrapped up in that too.

I’m using MyFitnessPal to track what I’m eating, most specifically focusing on calories and macronutrients (e.g. carbohydrates, fats and protein). In general, I feel much better when I’m eating a protein-rich diet, so being able to see what I’m eating and measure how I’m feeling in light of that is huge for me.

Food is a funny thing, and if I eat an apple instead of a piece of cake one time, I can use that single decision to [rationalize](https://jshirk.com/blog/rationalization/) bad choices throughout the day. I’m trying to use data to convince my brain that I’m not always (or even regularly) making healthy choices.

I enjoy working out and go to the gym regularly, but I haven’t seen any significant strength improvements or “toneness” in quite some time. Even if I worked out a ton (multiple hours a day, every day) I can still wreck my progress through poor eating.

All of this to say, MyFitnessPal has a huge database, you can scan bar codes, and you can import recipes (it even has a feature to do this automatically if you copy the link from a website). If you have a kitchen / food scale handy, the process is even better. For $20 you can get a [great one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001N07KUE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001N07KUE&linkCode=as2&tag=thepoiofimp-20&linkId=MBFZFDB2ONTMT6MI) that makes tracking more precise.

### Habits

#### [Habit List](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/habit-list-create-good-habits/id525102168?mt=8&at=11l4uNett)

I’m taking a different approach to reaching goals this year. There are still things I want to achieve, but for me, I’ve realized I need systems in place to help me accomplish goals instead of just blanket statements I’m aimlessly pursuing.

Rather than having a long list of goals, I’ve created a list of a handful of habits I want to practice each day. If I do those things daily, I will inevitably reach my goals.

I use Habit List to track my habits. It uses the “Seinfeld Method” of trying to create a chain of events by doing that activity every day, and then striving for not breaking the chain. I have some menial things like “Floss!” and more specific habits I want to form like “Practice Guitar for 20 minutes.” I think it is most helpful if you have a specific metric on there, so instead of “Read some of a book” go for “Read a book for at least 30 minutes.”

The interface is great and you can track all of your goal-reaching habits in one place.

### Mental State

#### [Day One](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one/id422304217?mt=12&at=11l4uNett)

I’m not sure anyone else will ever care about my regular journal entries, but I have a seriously shoddy memory when it comes to remembering the minute details of life, so it’s helpful when I can reference things later. I’ve started using Day One, and I use a simple template for answer a few questions about how I’m doing (reflection), what I’ve got coming up (planning), and things I accomplished or need to take care of (action). [footnote]Thanks to [Nick Stapleton](http://www.twitter.com/NickStapleton) for passing along his template, which I’ve adapted.[/footnote]

Day One is a beautiful app, and it supports writing in Markdown which makes formatting a breeze.

### Screen Time

#### [Moment App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moment-track-how-much-you/id771541926?mt=8&at=11l4uNett)

I want to be more present. I love using apps, reading, and learning, but I’ve looked down at my phone so frequently that I have 1. acquired chronic neck pain (this is embarrassing and self-induced) 2. been a crappy husband because I’m doing something with my phone instead of loving my wife well.

The Moment app is designed, primarily, to help parents monitor kids’ ’“screen time” [footnote]This is a such a nerdy term, but I love it.[/footnote]but it also tells you how long you’ve been using your phone each day. It defaults to alerting you every 15 minutes that you’ve been using your phone (i.e. when your screen is unlocked, so if you’re just listening to music or a podcast, it doesn’t count). I’ve been shocked at how many active minutes I’ve spent on my phone in the last few days alone.

The app also has an export feature, tells you your average for the week, and can be customized to alter alert times.

Moment works on iPads too. I’m less concerned tracking my time on my laptop because I normally only reach for that when I have serious writing or research to do (but sure, I get distracted on there too).

### Sleep

#### [Fitbit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fitbit/id462638897?mt=8&at=11l4uNett)

The main reason I’ve pulled the Fitbit out of the drawer and its long winter away from my pocket was for sleep tracking. There’s a feature which tells you how long you slept, how many times you woke up, and for how long you were restless.

This has been helpful in making sure I’m well rested and to see if there are patterns that lead to better sleep. [footnote]So far, shockingly, going to bed early leads to better sleep for me.[/footnote]

The Fitbit also has a silent alarm that vibrates you awake. If you’re waking up earlier than your spouse on a regular basis, this gets you major brownie points for not waking them up with your alarm. I feel like a ninja getting out of bed now because of the silent-ish alarm.

### Wrapping Up

Phew. 1,500 words on tracking habits later and we’ve got a pretty thorough rundown. If you’re pursuing a more quantified life, I’d love to hear what apps you’re using to track different aspects. I look forward to seeing what 2015 looked like through the lens of track at the end of the year.
