…when it comes to social media.

Twitter is **not** __about _your_ lunch.  
YouTube wasn’t designed to make _you_ famous.  
LinkedIn isn’t for _you_ to get a job.

Are they used like that? Sure. You can also use books as paperweights, email for spamming, and food for overeating. But that’s not the intended purpose.

In reality, however, when it comes to social media, it’s about everyone _but_ you.

**In business it’s about…**  
Connecting with your customers  
Listening to their concerns  
Providing an outlet for more information  
Linking your fans together

**In your personal life it’s about…**  
Helping spread ideas  
Developing relationships through a different channel  
Inspiring knowledge-seekers with insight  
Drawing connections others wouldn’t see

**For everyone it’s about…**  
Bringing people across the globe closer together  
Changing the way information flows  
Providing relief when disaster strikes  
Making a difference in the world

_Social media is not your stage_.  It’s your chance to connect with the crowd, bring people together, and create change.
