As a committed member of the Millennial Generation, I love to keep my options open.

Finality, conclusiveness, and decisiveness when better opportunities could arise make it difficult to commit.

As my wife and I prepare for the arrival of tiny human _[numero uno](https://twitter.com/jshirk/status/538706624882679808)_, we’ve done some rearranging in our city apartment. We converted our former guest room/office into a guest room/nursery, which meant my massive desk got the boot in favor of a changing table.

    The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OOYECC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000OOYECC&linkCode=as2&tag=thepoiofimp-20&linkId=CY7T7RBYOPGGBKV7">mStand</a> for my Macbook is the only thing redeeming the entire situation, because it allows me to still use my computer while I stand at my desk, but writing with a prehistoric utensil (like a pen) while standing is absolutely out of the questions unless I want to write at a 90° angle.

We chose the cheap but solid [NORBERG fold-down table](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30180504/) to function as my new desk stationary desk from our Swedish friends at IKEA. It fits nicely in our laundry room / office, which is, as those in real estate say of small places, _quite cozy_. I also thought I’d hop onto the standing desk bandwagon. However, as a true millennial I knew I wanted to have a standing desk that I could also occasionally sit at.

The thing about stationary desks is that they are either the proper height for standing or for sitting, but, as I recently discovered, can most certainly not be both. If you don’t choose one or the other and try to keep your desk options open, you end up with a surface that performs poorly in both ways.

Now that I’ve drilled half a dozen holes into the wall, I have a desk that’s a little too high for writing and a little too low for standing. A standing desk or sitting desk would have been just fine, but a sitting desk at my upper chest and a standing desk at my lower hip are less than fulfilling.

Often, you can’t have some things both ways. Many (most?) things in life are mutually exclusive, even two good things. You can’t pursue two goals that demand the _majority_ of your time.

So, choose. Today, make a choice to let a dream die in favor of a better one. Don’t try to jam together two puzzle pieces that aren’t quite right.

It’s nice to have options, but it’s better to choose one option, definitively, when the gap is too wide to split the difference.
