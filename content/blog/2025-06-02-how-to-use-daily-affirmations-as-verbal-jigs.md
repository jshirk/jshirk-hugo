Almost a decade ago, I wrote a [morning manifesto](https://jshirk.com/blog/morning-manifesto). I don't reference it daily, but I’ve made only minor edits since—mostly adding kids’ names as we’ve deepened our commitment to the cultural mandate.
  
What I wrote then still reflects who I want to become.

Lately, though, I’ve added a new habit: writing short, daily affirmations based on who I want to be today. Often, those affirmations emerge from who I wasn’t *yesterday*.

I want to be more patient. More present. More gracious.

But I need to remind myself _before_ the opportunity (often in tough moments) arises. 
## What Does the Bible Say About Affirmations?
  
The Bible doesn't use the word affirmations, but it constantly talks about how our thoughts shape our actions.

Paul tells us:

> Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.
 — _Colossians 3:2_

He gives specifics about the types of things to think about too: 

> Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable—if there is any excellence, if anything is worthy of praise—**think about these things**.
> — _Philippians 4:8_

And finally, he reminds us where transformation starts:

> Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the **renewal of your mind**, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
>—Romans 12:2

What we think about, the voices we listen to, and the stories we tell ourselves all shape our actions.

**Affirmations align our actions with our (ideal) identity.** 

Jesus modeled this. He lived perfectly from his identity as the beloved Son.

He regularly withdrew to quiet places to hear his Father’s voice and stay rooted in his identity.

Everything he did—his teaching, his actions, his miracles—flowed from his identity as God in the flesh.

Modern neuroscience agrees with what Scripture says: what we think about shapes who we become. The **Reticular Activating System (RAS)** in your brainstem filters what you pay attention to. When you tell your mind something is important, it starts noticing those moments more.

This is why you suddenly see blue Kias everywhere after purchasing one. They were always there. But now you're looking for them, even subconsciously. 

The Bible says it, Jesus shows it, and science supports: what we fill our mind with shapes what we see and how we live.
## Affirmations As Verbal Jigs

In woodworking, a **jig** is a tool that helps you repeat a precise task consistently—like drilling holes for cabinet hinges or cutting perfect circles with a router. 

Without a jig, repetition gets messy. Measurements drift. Things don’t line up.

I like to think of affirmations as **verbal jigs**.

You already know a tough situation will come up:

– Your kids misbehave.
– Your coworker misses a deadline.
– Your spouse forgets something they promised.

That’s the cue to use your jig—to apply your affirmation.

You can either react in your old, automatic way…

Or respond in the new way you’ve practiced:

- **When my kids misbehave**, I’ll remember that _it’s the kindness of the Lord that leads to repentance_.
- **When I’m in a rush and my kids aren’t**, I’ll remind myself that it’s probably an [apparent constraint](https://jshirk.com/blog/actual-constraints), not an actual one.
- **When a coworker drops the ball**, I’ll remember how often I fall short—and calmly clarify what we need to move forward.

The jig doesn’t make the cut or the hole for you. But it _guides_ your hand. **Affirmations act as verbal jigs to guide your mind into your ideal response.**

### **How to Build Affirmations that Work**

Gut reactions are hard to change. But here’s a simple, repeatable way to start putting your affirmations into action. 
### **1.** **Notice what needs to change.**

When you blow up, shut down, or spiral—pause. Pay attention. Identify what you did and why that response wasn't what you were hoping for.
### **2.** **Create your “verbal jig.”**

What would the _ideal_ response look like? Write it out. Be specific. Here’s one I wrote recently:

- ADD FROM JOURNAL

### **3.** **Practice remembering it before it happens.**

 It won’t be perfect. But even one moment of doing it differently is a massive win. That’s how you begin to rewire your reactions.

Affirmations aren’t about pretending.

They’re about **preparing**. We have to root ourselves in truths—even unrealized ones—before life shakes our limbs.

We can train our minds to react differently, but it’s an uphill battle. We have to use every tool available to us. 

Let’s stop just reacting and start practicing how we want to respond by using all the tools at our disposal.
