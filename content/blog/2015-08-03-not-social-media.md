This list is more for me than it is for you.

I’m a chronic checker of email and social media, and though these things can be beneficial, they can also be an absolutely ridiculous waste of time.

So I came up with a list of things I can do instead of checking my email or Twitter or Facebook. I hope it’ll be helpful.

It’s hard to flat out stop something, so let that _checky urge_ be a cue for you to do something different. Also, it can’t be too hard of a thing or you won’t do it instead.

So, turn your phone face&nbsp;down (unless the task tells you otherwise) and give something on this list a shot when you’re tempted to waste time on the social network de jour.

Save the good ones. Print this list. Add it to your home screen. Steal it and add your own. However you want to use it, it’s yours.[footnote]Bonus points and high fives all around if you do all of them in one day and don't check social media at all.[/footnote]
