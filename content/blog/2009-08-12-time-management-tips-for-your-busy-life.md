I’m not sure I’ve ever talked to anyone who admitted they weren’t busy.  What I love about busyness is that it is **totally relative**.  If you asked me my freshman year of college, when I went to one meeting and attended about eight hours of class per week, I would have told you I was busy.  And I wouldn’t have been lying.  You see, I didn’t know any different.  How can we possibly imagine being any busier than we’ve been at our most hectic point in life?  No matter how busy we are, we use all of our 24 hours doing _something_.

This fall, two years removed from my “busy” baptismal into the wonderful world of higher education, I’m taking twenty credit hours (of classes that I’m stoked for, mind you).  For people who are too old to remember how college credits work or too young to know what they are, at [Ohio University](http://www.ohio.edu) each credit hour (normally) translates into an hour worth of class per week.  It’s a full schedule, but I’m a nerd and I can’t wait to learn.  Each week, I have seven, roughly-hour-long meetings that are pretty much non-negotiable.  I’ll be doing [research](http://www.voinovichschool.ohio.edu/index.aspx) on [tech companies](http://www.techgrowthohio.com/) (and getting paid for it) 10 hours a week.  For more pocket augmentation, I’ll be working remotely for [Cardinal Health](http://www.cardinal.com) another 10 hours.  And I’m training for a [marathon](http://arizona.competitor.com/).  No really.

I’m not telling you all of that to brag (or as a cry for help).  I’m telling you to illustrate that any schedule can be maintained if you prepare properly (and occasionally sacrifice some shut-eye).  Right now, you are probably really busy, and you still think “This kid is crazy.”  But as I’ve said, busy is relative.  Busy for you is different than busy for me, and that is totally fine.  There’s no need to compare.  We’re all busy, and we need to prioritize no matter how much time we do or don’t have.  I didn’t turn into a busyaholic over night.  I gradually took on more responsibility (and majors) and worked up to my daunting schedule today.  Don’t get me wrong—I chose the chaotic life I lead.  I enjoy being busy.  It keeps me out of trouble, keeps me connected to the people I need to be around, and keeps me realizing that the Lord can provide even when you don’t seem to have enough hours in a day.

I don’t claim to be a master of anything, but I have a black belt in time management.  Here are eight tips to conquer your busy life.

  1. **Get organized.** It’s totally necessary and not that hard.  I have to write everything down in some form.  I use [Google Calendar](http://calendar.google.com)—it rocks my world. I’d forget to breathe if I didn’t have it scheduled.  Mark down your meetings and attach due dates to things on your [perpetual to-do list](http://www.thelincolnletters.net/2009/08/perpetual-to-do-list.html).
  2. **Review.** Look at your calendar before your day starts.  Don’t start your day all [willy-nilly](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/willy-nilly) not knowing what you have to get done.  See where you need to be when, and make sure you’re there—on time.  Which brings me to my next point…
  3. **Be punctual.** No one else cares how busy you are (because they are _obviously_ busier).  Don’t schedule a meeting from 10 to 11 and 10:30 to 12.  You’ll be late to the second one, and the person you’re meeting with won’t care if you were meeting with Barack Obama when you show up late.  It’s frustrating, and you’ll lose respect.  You’re saying, “My time is more important than yours.”  Don’t let that happen.
  4. **Prioritize.** You have to take a look at what you are responsible for and ask yourself, “What is the most important?”  Your priorities are your own, so I’m not going to tell you that playing World of Warcraft isn’t more important than going to class (but it isn’t).
  5. **Trim the fat.** You can’t do everything.  You can’t be all things to all people. Scratch anything from the list that isn’t adding value to you or others.  Don’t get caught up doing _good_ things when you should be making time for _great_ things.
  6. **Sacrifice.** Sometimes, you are going to have to miss out on things.  Your friends might be going to the movies to see _[Land Before Time XIV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Land_Before_Time_%28series%29)_, and you have to write a paper or prepare a presentation.  Try and plan ahead so you don’t have to, but be willing to sacrifice for things that you deem priorities.
  7. **Stay focused.** When you are really busy, you have to improvise.  You might find yourself scribbling down notes for a meeting on a gum wrapper on your way to class.  If you keep thinking, “What else can I do with my time?” you’ll achieve more than you could ever imagine.
  8. **Live in the moment.** Don’t get caught in the trap of mentally “checking-out” of something before it’s over.  I’m a huge offender of this one, and everyone can tell when you are out of it.  Don’t worry about what’s happening next until you get there.  You’re busy—we know—but just _be_.

These tips did a significantly enhanced my ability to juggle way-too-many-figurative-sharp objects at the same time.  You’ll find time you didn’t know you had.  You’ll want to take on more responsibilities but beware: **busy is as busy does.**
