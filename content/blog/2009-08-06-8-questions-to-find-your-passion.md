I officially retired from my unofficial career in journalism this past June. As far as I was concerned, I accomplished all I had hoped to in my time at [WOUB](http://www.woub.org). I made it onto TV, thoroughly enjoyed my time on air and the great people I worked with, but realized the news industry wasn’t for me. I was in it for the wrong reasons. In fact, I found that I rather hated news. I wanted to be on the small screen so that I could say I was on TV. It was vein. It was wrong. It was a poor career choice. Luckily, I righted my wrong.

I realized that journalism wasn’t my career passion. Now, don’t get me wrong, if I didn’t enjoy writing, you wouldn’t be here. I prefer it as a hobby. I call the shots. I write when I want to. I’m in charge. It’s a control issue, I know—I’m working on it. At any rate, through some soul searching, prayer, conversations, and internal struggles, I realized that while journalism may not be my greatest passion, I have plenty of other things I’m passionate about: faith, people, school, business, technology, fitness, etc. For a long time I struggled to answer the question: “What’s your passion?” If you’re having the same problem—maybe you’re looking for a career path or justification for investing in a hobby—ask yourself these eight questions to find out where your heart is.

1. **Where do I allocate my most valuable resources?** Sure, money is a good starting point to find your passion. If you spend all of your disposable income on exhaust pipes and spark plugs, maybe you should become a mechanic. But let’s dig a little deeper and see how you are spending your day. Everyone has been granted the same 24-hours to work with. No matter how rich or powerful you are, you still get same amount of time in a day as everyone else. Time is your most valuable resource, and where you spend most of your free time, you’ll most likely find your passion.  
2. **What do I talk about most frequently?** If you can’t stop talking about health care reform, you probably enjoy politics (and you’re probably annoying a whole lot of the people around you). That’s ok though, Mrs. Pelosi—your passion doesn’t have to be someone else’s, but other people can help you find yours…  
3. **What do my friends think I’m passionate about?** Ask your friends what they think. You might not realize how much time you spend on nutrition blogs or how often you tell Jimmy something is absolutely loaded in saturated fat, but he certainly will. Use your friends as a resource for finding your passion.  
4. **What do I feel lost without?** If you’re in wild debt at Blockbuster or you can’t go a day without checking your mail for your newest Netflix delivery, you probably love movies. Nothing wrong with that. Start a blog, Ebert. Crank out a few reviews and turn being a couch potato into a career (or at least a more redeemable hobby).  
5. **What brings you the greatest enjoyment?** If you can’t stop smiling when you find out someone you know is having a baby, or you have a tendency to help people in need, you have a passion for people&#8211;one of the greatest of them all.  
6. **What am I good at?** If you’re a Top Chef, get some new cookbooks, Emeril. Expand on what you’re good at. It’s easier to be passionate about something you have a natural knack for.  
7. **What am I intrigued by more than other people?** If you think a [2 TB Memory Stick](http://www.engadget.com/2009/08/05/sony-announces-specs-for-2tb-memory-stick-xc) is the coolest thing since sliced bread, but your friends don’t give a hoot, you might love technology. It’s ok if you’re easily entertained by things that seem uninteresting to other people—you’re looking for your own passion, not your friend’s.  
8. **If I could only do one thing for the rest of my life, what would it be?** That’s a tough question. But when you find the one interest you could pursue for the rest of your life, you’ll find your passion.

If you’re still struggling to find your passion, don’t be disheartened! Try new things. Ask your friends. And check out this [ridiculously long list of hobbies](http://www.notsoboringlife.com/list-of-hobbies/) you’ve probably never heard of to get some extra blood flowing to your cranium.

_Your thoughts: What’s your passion, and how did you find it?_
