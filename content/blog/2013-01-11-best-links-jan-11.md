Sometimes the Internet features pretty neat things. I sift through all the junk and leave you with the weekly gold, right here. Enjoy.

In November 2010, I started a [charity: water project](http://mycharitywater.com/jshirk) in the hopes of raising $5,000 for clean water. Thanks to the generosity of people who care, (just) over $5,000 was raised. This week I (and many of you) received a report detailing the three projects between Ethiopia and Malawi.

116 donations changed the lives of 534 people.

Here's a great shot of the [plaque on the well](http://www.mycharitywater.org/p/myprojectsview?project_id=ET.GOH.Q1.11.083.584&campaign_id=9821&img=8052/8123071365_ccb405de2f_b.jpg#click_project-gallery-1) in Ethiopia, lest we forget how it all happened.<!--more-->

A quick reminder of why we do the dirty work, even if it's non-essential.

[The Verses Project](http://theversesproject.com)

A fairly regular posting on verses to memorize from the Bible, often times with attachments of iPhone and iPad wallpapers.

If a verse contains a higher number of attachments, it's likely to contain wallpapers. If it's only one attachment, it probably doesn't have wallpapers.

[Here](http://theversesproject.com/verses/58) [are](http://theversesproject.com/verses/59) a [few](http://theversesproject.com/verses/61) [neat](http://theversesproject.com/verses/55) verse [wallpapers](http://theversesproject.com/verses/49) from _The Verses Project._
