I don't care much for Major League Soccer. I don't follow the Euro Leagues. I couldn't even name more than a handful of soccer _fútbol_ players. _I haven't kicked a ball since second grade._

**But I'm obsessed with the World Cup.**

In 2006 I swore I'd go see it in person the next time around. (I missed that, but I'll be in [Slovenia](http://thesloveniaproject.com) when they play the US, so I say it's a close second. [See you in 2014](http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/brazil2014/index.html)?).

I get juiced up for the games. I've finally got a handle on the rules (yes, even [stoppage time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football#Gameplay)). **I even have a** [**vuvuzela**](http://abcnews.go.com/International/Media/vuvuzela-banned-world-cup/story?id=10908539) **I blow during the entire game.**

I've tried to enjoy watching the games more than once every four years, but it's like trying to watch Track and Field outside of the Summer Olympics&#8211;it's just not the same.

**I'm spoiled.**

As Americans, we get to see the best of the best in all of our major sports. We see the best basketball players, best hockey players, best baseball players–every time we turn on the TV. When I watch anything less than the world's greatest, I'm bored.

# 5 Ways to Live A World Cup Life

The World Cup is unreal. It's something truly special that transcends sports. **It's an event that rivals the Olympics for world competition and patriotism.** I think there's something to be said for living your life like the World Cup. Here's how.

**1. Surround Yourself with the Best of The Best–**One thing that makes the World Cup so great is that you're surrounded by the best of the best. [I've talked about it before](http://jshirkman.wordpress.com/2009/08/24/show-me-your-friends-and-ill-show-you-your-future/), but who you're surrounded with greatly influences who you'll become. Get around World Cup-quality people. They'll push you to be better than you ever imagined. Make connections, build relationships and spend time with those people, and then help others do the same.

**2. Do something Great; Don't** **Settle for a Few Little Things–**The World Cup happens once every four years. It would lose it's luster if it was an every year gig. When you're playing to hold a trophy for four years, there are no holds barred. I think you can do good things every day. But don't just settle for a string of good things. Strive to take the time to do something great. Don't just blog every day, string together a book instead. Don't just volunteer, create a movement. We need good things, but even more, we need great things.

3. **Train To Compete–**You don't just wake up one day and start running around for 90 minutes. We see one month of competition but we don't see the other 47 months of training that go into the World Cup. _Train every day._ Prepare yourself for the great things you want to do. You've got to make a decision every day to get better and have the foresight to see all the effort today will pay off in a big way in the 89th minute.

4. **Play Through Injuries**–Some days you're going to get kicked in the ribs. Some times you're going to have to step out to the sidelines. A whole lot of times, you're going to have to play through. When someone tears you down, stabs you in the back, leaves you out to dry, play through. Dust yourself off, pick yourself up, and keep at it. It's not easy, but doing great things never are.

**5. Realize You're A Part of Something Bigger**&#8211;It's one of the greatest honors in the world to play for a countries World Cup team, and only a few handfuls get the opportunity. **What you do every day isn't just about you&#8211;you're a part of something bigger.** Your job, your influence, your circle of friends, the life you lead is impacting people one way or another. Consider it an honor to be in the position you are with the people you know. Live for something larger than yourself.
