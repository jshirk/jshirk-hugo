Are you overwhelmed with fear?  Fear of natural catastrophes?  Fear of the unkown?  Fear of life after death?

Max Lucado’s latest piece of outright artwork, _Fearless_, gives you reason to cast away your fears.  In the book, fear is exposed what it really is: an opportunity to strengthen your faith and overcome the unwarranted sensation that makes us check under the bed for the boogie monster.

Lucado maneuvers you through the world of fear like a guide on a jungle safari—showing us how to hack away at the unjust emotion in front of us so that we can face each day without worry.

I can’t recommend this book highly enough.  I honestly feel like I’ve been missing out on so much by not picking up a Max Lucado book on the first day I learned how to read.  It challenged me to view fear in a whole new light—to approach it with confidence and courage.  Lucado’s insight, writing style, and sense of humor will keep you the book glued to your hand (so don’t pick it up if you have to drive anywhere, or you don’t have about six straight hours to pound it out).

**Who should read it?** Anyone with fear in his or her life: from the minute to the overwhelming.

**Who shouldn’t read it?** Even the self-proclaimed fearless can get something out of this book.

**Worth the price?** You’ll regret not buying this.  Don’t get on the library waiting list—order it and make sure you have a highlighter handy.
