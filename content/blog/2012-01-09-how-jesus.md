[What Would Jesus Do](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_would_Jesus_do%3F) dominated wristbands in the 90s (but it's hard to give much credit to 90s trends when dressing like the [Fresh Prince](http://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/system/images/thumbs/www/articles/fresh_prince_of_bel_air_will_smith_300x309.jpg?1308155550) was cool and wearing [backwards pants](http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1320941601_kriss_kross.jpg) was totally acceptable).

In reality, the WWJD bands caused people to pause and ponder what Jesus would do in their shoes. It's a great question for analyzing situations and (hopefully) making good decisions based on how we think the Messiah would respond.

**But being like Jesus isn't just doing what he would do. It's about thinking how he would think too.**

As I think about stewarding my time, resources, and abilities, I'm beginning to ask myself, &#8220;How would Jesus do this?&#8221;

How would Jesus share the gospel with his family?  
How would he make disciples in the 21st century?  
**How would Jesus spend his time?**  
How would Christ compel others to live for God if he was giving a lecture today?  
How would he respond to an atheist?

As I ask myself, &#8220;How would Jesus do this,&#8221; and read about his life in the Bible, I'm convinced that he wouldn't just slop together work or participate half-heartedly in conversations.

He was a student of his disciples and the people he talked with. He did an incredible job of asking heart-level questions that cleared away the clutter, distractions and barriers in conversations. Jesus took his time when others thought he should hurry along (in the case of his friend [Lazarus](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011&version=ESV)), and he withdrew when others thought he should stick around (like when they tried to make him a [politician](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6:15&version=ESV)).

You don't have an infinite source of divine knowledge like Jesus, and you probably don't know any lepers to heal, even if you were able. **But Christians certainly have the ability to listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit, turn to God's Word for direction, and trust the promise of Jesus that we'd do [greater works](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:12&version=ESV) than he did.**

All we have to do is seek God's wisdom as we ask, &#8220;How would Jesus do this?&#8221;
