I love hearing about what other people are reading, so I wanted to do unto others as I would have them do unto me&#8211;share books I'm hoping to read.

There are now hundreds of thousands of books published every year In a world of information abundance, I hate picking up a book that isn't worth my time.

![Image](/images/reading-list.jpeg) 

Here are the topics I'm most interested in:

  * Jesus
  * Marriage
  * Stewardship
  * Discipleship
  * Leadership
  * Theology
  * Missiology
  * Exegesis
  * Christian Living
  * Biography

Here's this year's partial list. I'm sure I won't read all of these books, and there are others I'll likely come across and pick up instead of some listed below. I've listed the book title and author and they're sorted by category. If you want to find the list on Amazon organized by title, [click here](http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/2FMXCMCUAFOM3/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&filter=all&layout=standard&linkCode=ur2&reveal=unpurchased&sort=universal-title&tag=thepoiofimp-20&x=6&y=9).
