I rarely condone taking the advice of musicians who repeatedly make terribly inappropriate and outlandish comments and often make fools of themselves, but <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Kanye West</span> John Mayer used the stage as a soapbox Friday night in Columbus, and I agreed with him nearly whole-heartedly.

> ### A calling is a calling because it comes from a voice far away. You have to make sacrifices. You'll have to give things up, but following your calling is the most important thing you can do.

This is most certainly a paraphrase because John took the liberty of rambling and all but worshipping his guitar, but at the very core of his message, I agree with him.

## **Defining a Calling**

I completely believe we're all called to a specific purpose (and even further, from a Voice far away). We've all been blessed with different opportunities, different gifts, and different circumstances to follow our calling.

The world often tries to tell us what we were made to do&#8230;  
&#8220;You're tall, you should play basketball.&#8221;  
&#8220;You're smart, you should be a teacher.&#8221;  
&#8220;You're a great actor, you should be a pro wrestler.&#8221;

But what you're called to do is much greater than one or two of your attributes. A calling is something much deeper, much more profound than a hunch or suggestion based on what the world sees. A calling is something that consumes your entire life. Something that forces you to forgo things others wouldn't dream of giving up&#8211;to do things that from the outside others would consider crazy but from the inside makes perfect sense.

Refuse to let others define your calling for you. Listen to the voice far off in the distance. Squint to narrow in on the blurry future that's just out of focus. Find your calling. Now, follow it.

## **Following a Calling**

When you truly follow your calling, the world is a better place. Things won't always be easy, but you'll know you're making a difference, you're doing the right thing, you're making efforts to help people with what you've been given. You're giving your art to the world through your calling.

The problem is that all too often we trade in our calling for settling. Too many of us settle for &#8216;just fine' when we should be striving for &#8216;called to'.

You're not a writer, you were called to spreading ideas that challenge people's thinking. You're not a musician, you were called to making a sound that excites, inspires, and challenges people. You're not a missionary, you were called to changing lives through your interactions with people across the world.

_A calling is always bigger than you_. Following your calling inspires others to follow theirs. It's truly the most important thing you can do.

## **Personal Calling**

I'm still trying to discern my calling. I pray about it, think about it, and aspire to discover it each day. Right now, I'm doing anything I can that helps other people in any capacity through:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blogging</span>: It's not for me, it's for you. If any one of my posts makes you view things differently, inspires or motivates, fires you up, makes life easier, more exciting or enjoyable in any capacity, every ounce of effort I've put into this makes it all worth it.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interactions</span>: I've failed to do it effectively lately, but one of my favorite questions to ask people is &#8220;How can I make your life easier?&#8221; Rarely do people give me anything tangible, but I do whatever I can to fulfill a request if when I get a direct response.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Giving</span>: I give my time to people I think I can help. I give my talents to organizations I think can use them. I give my funds to people and movements that are making a difference.

A calling is the most important thing you can follow. Find yours and give everything up for it.

_Your thoughts: What do you feel you are called to do? What have you given up to fulfill it? How are you trying to find your calling today?_
