When something doesn't work, do you ask why bother or why not?

When you're presented with an opportunity, do you ask why not try it or why should I?

When you are considering trying something new (blogging, skiing, college, career change), are you asking why put in the effort or why not give it a whirl?

When you're asking if you should reach out to someone, are you asking why waste my time or why miss this connection?

When someone contacts you (and only you) for something, do you ask why me or why not someone else?

When you feel defeated, do you ask why keep going or why stop here?

**Most of the time, if it's the right thing to do, you'll get the same answer to both questions.**
