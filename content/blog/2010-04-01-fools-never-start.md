We've all heard the cliche &#8220;Fools rush in (where angels fear to tread).&#8221;

It seems like sound advice, but I feel all too often &#8220;Fools never start.&#8221; We calculate, analyze, triple check, and stir over. We hypothesize, procrastinate, dream and don't take action.

**The problem all too often isn't rushing in, it's failing to start.**

Fools never start&#8230;  
&#8230;taking chances when they have a hunch.  
&#8230;reaching out when they know they should.  
&#8230;asking why when things seem amiss.  
&#8230;risking it all and figuring out the details later when pursuing a passion.  
&#8230;leading because they feel they are unqualified.  
&#8230;expressing their ideas because they are afraid they'll be stolen.  
&#8230;rejecting the status quo for what they know is better.  
&#8230;taking steps to make change.  
&#8230;accepting responsibility and refusing to blame others for circumstances.

Don't be afraid to rush in. Take a chance. Make a stand. Refuse to settle.

**Fools aren't the ones failing. Fools are the ones who are afraid to fail.**

_Your thoughts: Is &#8220;fools never start&#8221; really accurate?_
