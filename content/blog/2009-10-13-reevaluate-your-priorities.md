Lately, my posts have been few and far between.  For that, I apologize; unfortunately, I can’t promise it’s going to get any better any time soon.

I’ve been challenged to reevaluate how I spend my time.  Discovering where you invest most of your time will show you where your priorities lie.  While I’ve gotten pretty good at [time management](http://jshirkman.wordpress.com/2009/08/12/time-management-tips-for-your-busy-life/), I haven’t completely prioritized what I’ve been doing.

I’ve been scrambling for the last six weeks to keep my feet underneath me, and so far I’ve made it.  Now that I’ve had a chance to catch my breath, I’ve realized I have some rearranging to do.

I need to spend more time in The Word and that has to be my biggest priority.  There aren’t enough hours in the day to accomplish everything I want, so I have to be selective in my activities.  Some things go to the chopping block and some have to wait it out on the bench for now.

**My number one priority is to bring glory to the Lord and live a life that brings others closer to Him.** I’d be a hypocrite if I said that my entire existence hinges on Christ’s death on the cross, but then just barely sprinkled in a little Jesus time in between training for a marathon and writing blog posts.  He must to be my number one priority, even if it means sacrificing other worthy causes in the midst.

I challenge you to reevaluate your priorities.  If school is one of your top priorities, why do you study less than you play video games?  If you say relationships are important to you, why do you eat alone instead of calling a friend?

**If you say Jesus is the most important thing in your life, why are you making him a spice in your life instead of the main ingredient?** What are you living for, and what are you doing to make that the number one thing in your life?
