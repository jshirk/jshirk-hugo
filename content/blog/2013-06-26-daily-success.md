What gets measured gets improved.

I'm reasonably obsessed with personality tests, measurements, data, information and using those tools to make better decisions. Unfortunately, I have a tendency to collect data and then do nothing with it [\*&#8221;Some day I will,&#8221;\* I assure myself] or to flat out collect the wrong data.

**I normally measure the success of my day by how many things I accomplished and how many things I left unfinished. **I never check off all the boxes on any given day because I'm constantly thinking of more things I need (or would like) to do. Instead of evaluating my day by the number of boxes checked and list items crossed off, I felt led to completely change my method of evaluation.

At the end of each day, I've started to ask myself these two questions.<!--more-->

## Do I love God more today than I did yesterday?

## Did I love people better today than I did yesterday?

As I've shared before, [comparison][1] robs us of joy, but self-reflection and personal evaluation leads to a life well-stewarded. **If we don't evaluate where we're heading, we set off with no destination, and we'll surely end up somewhere unintentional without course correction.**

Now, at the end of my day, I simply ask the two most important questions [those that Jesus summed up as the key to the entire law in [Mark 12:30-31](http://www.esvbible.org/Mark+12%3A30-31/)].

**Love God and love others.**

Here are a few sub-questions for each to dig deeper into evaluation.

## Do I love God more today than I did yesterday?

  * Did I experience communion with God today?
  * Did I spend time connecting with God through his Word and prayer?
  * Did I honor him with my thoughts, words and actions?
  * Did I flee temptation and quickly confess sin when I fell short?

## Did I love people better today than I did yesterday?

  * Did I go out of my way to help people?
  * Was I patient with those I interacted with?
  * Did my words and actions encourage or discourage others?
  * Did I point people to Jesus?
  * Did I think more often of others than I did of myself?
  * Did I mostly serve or was I mostly served?

Two simple questions, but as I've already begun to experience, difficult answers. A much-needed reality check and course correction at the end of my day.

### Here's to measuring what truly matters.

[Not to mention, good questions to add to the end of my [manifesto](https://jshirk.com/blog/morning-manifesto/) to set the tone for my day.]

## Questions: How do you evaluate if you've had a successful day? What questions do you use to reflect on your day?
