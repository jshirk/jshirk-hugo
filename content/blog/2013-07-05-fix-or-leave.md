It's easy for me to think my way is the correct way (which is clearly linked to my [impatience](https://jshirk.com/blog/what-impatience-is/) and pride). Obviously, my way isn't always right, isn't the only right way, and isn't necessarily the best way.

When you're leading, I think the best way to empower team members is to give them clear expectations about where you're heading and what you hope to achieve (vision) while also giving them the freedom to work how they feel best (flexibility).

Sometimes people do things in ways we don't think is best. That's when letting them stay flexible is hard. A sudden urge to micro-manage boils up when they say things we don't agree with. Or if they act in ways we wouldn't act.

Sometimes they are wrong. They need to be corrected. Someone (you, if you're the leader) needs to talk with them.

Other times the way they do or say something that gets under your skin. It bothers you and rubs you the wrong way. But it's actually not fundamentally wrong or hurtful or even in need of correction. It's just preference.<!--more-->

**I've found that a key to leading is deciding what to correct and what to let go.** It's deciding if you need to swing a hammer to pound a nail a little deeper or letting it go in fear of splitting the wood. That's not always an easy balance to find.

So here's how I do it.

## Knowing When to Fix It or Leave It In Leading a Team

### 1. Will this approach still get the job done?

If it won't then it needs to be corrected immediately. If it will, next question.

### 2. Is this the best way to get things done?

If it's not, how far off from the best way is it? Will a 1-hour job turn into a 10-hour job? If yes, help them fix it. If it's just part of their process, let it go.

### 3. Is the way they are going about it hurting themselves, the team or the organization?

If yes, fix it, definitely. If not, it's probably a preference thing.

### 4. Is this an opportunity to coach them in growing in their skill set?

When I coach people, I try to ask them why they do things the way they do so I can understand more fully. If they have solid reasoning, I might still press in with more follow-up questions if I still think there is an error in their approach. If they aren't sure why they do it, that's an opportunity to ask, &#8220;Is there a better way?&#8221; or &#8220;What if you tried this?&#8221;

**As a leader, your job is to be constantly analyzing and improving.** Not everyone is thinking that way, so improvement in small things or skills isn't always on their radar. That's a great opportunity for growth.

### 5. Is this behavior or approach linked to a fundamental personality trait?

If someone is quirky, it's hard for me to tell them to turn that off. Maybe tone it down, maybe watch what they say, but I want to be careful to respect how they were made and let their work style flow from that. If it's a glaring character issue, let's fix it. Otherwise, let's grin and bear it en route to appreciating it.

### 6. Is it just me that doesn't like it?

Sometimes I'm hypercritical and hypersensitive. I'm trying to mellow out. We as people are just awkward and weird sometimes. _That's ok._ It's part of being human.

If it's not just me that it's affecting, then I might take the opportunity to ask more questions and get a deeper understanding to decipher it and then decide if it's worth correcting.

## Question: How do you decide what to help people fix and what to let go?
