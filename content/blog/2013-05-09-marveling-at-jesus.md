[Mike Mobley](https://twitter.com/MikeJMobley) at [_Before the Cross_](http://beforethecross.com) invited me to guest post, and I describe how my lack of understanding of the Grand Canyon and its beauty relates to my lack of understanding about Jesus and who he is.

Here's a little taste to whet your appetite:

> I think, for most of us, we treat Jesus a lot like the Grand Canyon.
> 
> We've heard a fair amount of stories.
> 
> We know he's a pretty impressive guy.
> 
> We've possibly even placed our faith in him and say we know him personally.
> 
> But we haven't even begun to explore the depths and riches of who Jesus really is.
