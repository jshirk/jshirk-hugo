Explaining a new idea without context can be smash-your-head-against-the-wall frustrating.

There are too many things you want to say, too many options of what to explain, too many directions to go.

I recently read the free ebook [_The Myth of the Garage_](http://www.amazon.com/The-Myth-Garage-ebook/dp/B0061UC83A) by Chip and Dan Heath. They included an essay that describes anchoring, a solution to our aimless elaborations without boundaries.

> Innovations require lots of explaining&#8230;Explanations require lots of attention, but attention is scarce. So don't explain. Instead, anchor your communication in what people already know&#8230;

Anchoring is latching your idea to something that already exists and using that as a launching pad. Of course, you can't just say &#8220;_We're like Starbucks_.&#8221; You need what the Heath brothers call &#8220;a twist.&#8221;

> The only downside to anchoring is that, by hooking into existing ideas, it creates sameness. But to sell something you need difference. It doesn't work to say, &#8220;Introducing Gleemy toothpaste&#8211;it's perfectly interchangeable with Crest!&#8221;

> That's why a good innovation story couples an anchor with a twist.

**When you're dreaming of a new product, organization or mission, context is key.** Give an example, an anchor, for people to latch onto so they can see where you're going.<!--more-->

The Heath brothers say anchoring is necessary for breakthrough technologies. I agree.

But I think anchoring is helpful for anyone in sales, marketing, or ministry. Saying &#8220;We're building movements every where so that everyone knows someone who truly follows Jesus&#8221; is helpful. It tells what we're about. But saying something like, &#8220;We want to be like Walgreens in Chicago&#8211;a movement within reach for everyone in the world.&#8221; **An anchor gives context for what we're hoping to achieve.**

The beauty of anchoring is that it's simple and instantly understandable if done well.Â Take a well-known event or product or company, name drop and add what makes you unique. I think it's also helpful to have a follow-up line to give even more clarity if someone is interested. The anchor helps people understand what you're after, and the twist helps people see the potential. You'll leave them saying, &#8220;_Oh, yeah! I totally wish there was an automatic car wash for dogs_.&#8221; This is where the free marketing comes into play.

A key thing to keep in mind: don't use trite examples or leave things to ambiguity.

&#8220;_We want to be the next Apple_&#8221; is completely unhelpful.

You want to sell phones? Or tablets? Or digital music?

**Let your anchor give clarity, a baseline, and then make sure you twist.**

_We're the Bonaroo for Christian music._

_It's a library for movies._

_We're the [Dollar Shave Club](http://dollarshaveclub.com) for socks._

I'm still trying to figure out my anchor and twist for this blog, but when I do, you'll be the first to know.

## Question: How would you anchor your business or yourself? What comparisons would you draw?
