I made a huge mistake when I ran my marathon.

Experienced marathoners warned me about it. They said I would have problems. I didn't listen, I figured they didn't know me well enough to give me their two cents.

**Spoiler Alert:** I was wrong.

The mistake I made? I didn't train hard enough.

I didn't put in enough miles. I didn't run at a fast enough pace. I slacked in the last month between the holidays because I couldn't step away from the turkey and ham long enough to put in some real mileage.

**And it killed me.**

**<span style="font-weight: normal;">I struggled through the last ten miles. I was hurting. The soreness was unreal, I could barely run for five minutes at a time, and I must have looked like I was a stone throw away from collapsing because I can't even guess Â how many spectators asked me if I was going to make it.</span>**

This principle translates so clearly to everything we do in life. You can't say you're going to be a doctor, skip out on college and medschool and then show up in an operating room with a scalpel and ask someone where you're supposed to start cutting.

**If you want to accomplish something great, you've got to be willing to sacrifice to prepare for it.**

Writers don't crank out first drafts that get published; they painstakingly edit, rewrite, re-edit, delete, add, and totally give up on projects before they create a book worthy of newsstands.

All-star athletes (outside of [Allen Iverson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGDBR2L5kzI)) don't skip out on practicing their shots, spin moves, or swings and then go out and win a title.

Everything you do, every single day, is training for something. Training to be more compassionate, training to be a better friend, training to become a better teacher or wife or student.

**The more you train, the more success you will have.**

Don't lose sight of the goal at hand. Practice who you want to be today, and train what you want to achieve. You'll thank me when your day comes.
