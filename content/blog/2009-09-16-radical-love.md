Have you ever known someone who was so out there, so different, so distinctly contradictory to the norm that you wanted to know what was at their core—what they believed and why the acted the way they did?

Have you ever been that person?  Have you ever acted in a way so unselfishly, with such a servant’s heart that people said, “Why are you doing this?”

What if we all acted that way?  What if for **one day** we put ourselves at the bottom of the totem pole?  What if we acted in _a love so unbelievable_ people noticed we were focused on something outside of ourselves?  What if we acted as if deep down in our hearts, at our innermost point, there was something so unshakeable that we could act radically different because of our faith in that?

What if we lived every day like a follower of Christ that had more love than we knew what to do with?  What if we served and loved our friends and families and strangers so much that they could almost see the love oozing from our pores?

What if we paid for a stranger’s lunch, or picked up someone’s books after they dropped them, or let someone with 100 things at the grocery store go ahead of us buying a single pack of gum because they look rushed?

**What if we genuinely asked people how they were doing and cared about the response?** What if we went out of our way to call someone we know is hurting just to tell them they are loved?

What if we looked beyond material things and acted as if nothing on this planet mattered more than the creator of it and the people he put on it?

What if you did all of those things and through your love and actions and faith in Jesus Christ you were used to draw people to the Lord?

What if I told you **that’s how we should live every day**?
