I'm forgetful. I'm a _very_ good forgetter of important things.

Somehow, I manage to forget some of the most critical parts of my life. Like loving God and my wife. That I'll die. My life is not a vacation. Simple things that are hard to remember all at once.

I decided it was time to write a manifesto. Things I need reminded of daily. Things I know somewhere in the deep recesses of my heart, but that I can't seem to surface without some brain-jarring via morning reading.

I've printed this list out to read through each morning, before I do anything else. It takes less than 4 minutes to read aloud and it's full of truth, high fives and pointer-fingers driven into the chest. It may seem a bit harsh at times, but it's what I need from myself.

Feel free to remind me when you see me forgetting these things. Also, I'd love to hear if you do anything to remind yourself of truth you need to hear each morning.

## 1. Jesus is your Holy King.

He reigns over all creation and he's graciously allowed you to be his servant. He is worthy of _all_ your affections.

_Isaiah 6:3_  
_And one called to another and said:_  
_“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;_  
_the whole earth is full of his glory!”_

## 2. God loves you more than you can imagine.

That's because he sees you as he sees Jesus&#8211;perfect. Focus on your communion with him over your performance. He delights in you.

_Zephaniah 3:17_  
_The Lord your God is in your midst,_  
_a mighty one who will save;_  
_he will rejoice over you with gladness;_  
_he will quiet you by his love;_  
_he will exult over you with loud singing._

## 3. Niki is your top priority after God.

She is one with you. She loves you. Your job is to love and cherish her more every day. Serve her and pray for her today.

_Ephesians 5:25_  
_Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her._

## 4. Sin will kill you.

It isn't worth it. It won't satisfy you. It isn't what it seems. The only offer it has is death.

_Proverbs 28:13_  
_Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper,_  
_but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy._

## 5. Pursue humility in all ways at all times.

The world does not revolve around you. You are the least important person in any room you step into. Everyone you meet is more important than you because you are here to serve. Being humble means having thick skin, too. Don't be too proud to take criticism and learn from it.

_James 4:6_  
_But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”_

## 6. You're not on vacation, you're in a battle.

This Earth is not your home. Do not seek comfort, seek to be faithful.

_Ephesians 6:12_  
_For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places._

## 7. You will die one day.

Live like it. Love God, love people, do important things and stop wasting your time.

_Psalm 144:4_  
_Man is like a breath; his days are like a passing shadow._

## 8. Things will go wrong today.

Don't panic. It's not worth letting little things stress you out. Relax, laugh and correct course.

_Romans 8:18_  
_For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us._

## 9. People are broken.

Don't yell at them, get frustrated with them, or do anything to hurt them. Love them. The enemy has blinded many of them. The others are your brothers and sisters.

_II Corinthians 4:4_  
_In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God._

## 10. Don't let anything but grace pass through your lips.

Don't gossip, encourage. Don't demean, uplift. Don't cut with words, exhort in love.

_Ephesians 4:29_  
_Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear._

## 11. Be crazy generous.

With your time, with your money, with your ideas and life. Sacrifice. You'll be rewarded.

_Matthew 6:19-21_  
_Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also._

## 12. Make disciples.

Pour your life out. Be vulnerable. Spend time building up other men. Your clock is ticking and the mission isn't finished. Get after it.

_Matthew 28:19_  
_Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit._

## Question: Is there any morning ritual you have to remind yourself of what you need to remember each morning?
