**I take things for granted all too often.**

This is my attempt at realizing how much I have to be thankful for. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but instead just a start of the nouns I've been so richly blessed by.

<!--more-->1. Waking up every morning knowing 

[I am accepted and forgiven](http://www.marshillchurch.org/about/the-gospel) as a child of God [which will forever be a mystery]  
2. A family that loves me and encourages me [and blows me away with [their support](http://mycharitywater.org/jshirk)]  
3. A [wonderful woman](http://twitter.com/nbair) I don't deserve [and who loves me despite my flaws]  
4. [Clean water](http://mycharitywater.org/jshirk) [and the opportunity to bring it to others]  
5. [Living in the best country in the world](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZD4ezDbbu4) [and objectively knowing it]  
6. [The opportunity to attend college](http://ohio.edu) [and all that the experience has brought me]  
7. [Hilarious](http://www.facebook.com/gregsilverman) [roommates](http://www.facebook.com/zac.martin1) [and the log cabin we live in]  
8. [Friends that inspire me to do great things](https://jshirk.com/blog/2009/08/show-me-your-friends-and-ill-show-you-your-future/) [and their decisions to run alongside me]  
9. [Christmas Blend](http://www.starbucksstore.com/products/shprodde.asp?SKU=312780) [and all that is a coffee shop between Thanksgiving and Christmas, especially]  
10. [Books](http://sethgodin.com/sg/books.asp) [especially Seth's and the impact they've had on me]  
11. [Blogging](https://jshirk.com/blog/2009/08/this-is-why-i-blog/) [and the opportunities this outlet has brought me]  
12. [Football](http://clevelandbrowns.com) [and the way Cleveland sports has made me tougher]  
13. [Viral Videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKsVSBhSwJg) [and the way they [help people move out of the ghetto](http://www.therundown.tv/headlines/just-in/antoine-dodson-moves-his-family-out-of-the-projects/)]  
14. [Free shipping](http://www.amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info) [and the joys of getting packages in the mail for much cheaper than you get the same item unpackaged at the store]  
15. [Fitness](https://jshirk.com/blog/2010/01/indescribable/) [and all that it's helped me achieve]  
16. [My job](http://centerforcollegeaffordability.org) [and colleagues who make it a joy to come to work]  
17. [Cookies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhUFxaauNTE) [because they taste so good]

Today, let's not just say what we're thankful for. Let's do something about it.

  * Tell the people in your life that you're grateful for their impact and influence
  * Thank the Lord through prayers
  * Write a note [_with your hand!_] to someone you appreciate
  * **[Donate](http://mycharitywater.org/jshirk) to someone who isn't as fortunate as you**
  * Volunteer to ring a bell or dish out soup to help those in need
  * **Let someone know you love them**
  * Buy coffee for a stranger
  * At thanksgiving dinner, ask everyone to share what they appreciate about the person next to them
  * **Help someone anonymously**
  * Share what you have
  * Do something difficult with the platform and opportunities you have

**Let's make this the most thankful year yet.**
