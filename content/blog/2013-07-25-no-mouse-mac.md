The mouse was a beautiful invention for the personal computer. But it's mostly unnecessary. I still use it quite often, but I'm trying to move more swiftly through the digital world, rocking the keyboard instead of the mouse. It's faster because you don't have to move your hands and waste time repositioning (wow, I'm a nerd).

_(Confession: I just used the mouse and now I'm kicking myself. I definitely haven't mastered this yet.)_

If you're ready to be so fast and so furious, so you can get back to the things that matter, check out my favorite shortcuts below.

I haven't included every keyboard shortcut, but only the ones that I find the most helpful. I'd love to hear what some of your favorite shortcuts are in the comments.<!--more-->

Don't worry about memorizing all of these to start. Pick a few you think will be helpful and work from there. If you have to constantly look up what each shortcut is, it defeats the purpose. I gave everyone the benefit of the doubt for cut, copy, paste and print.

If you want to get really fancy with keyboard shortcuts, I highly recommend the app [SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/) which allows you to use keyboard shortcuts to resize your windows. I'm a big fan and don't know how I lived without it before. It makes taking notes in one program while reading an article or watching a video in another an absolute breeze.

## Question: What are your favorite keyboard shortcuts?
