**Most things we need to do to succeed are boring. **But we all want a perfect formula that does the work for us. Something new, flashy, _easy_.

That's why ridiculous fad diets, get-rich quick schemes and overnight success are all the rage. We know what it takes to change, succeed, and win, but we know those things are _hard_.

Everyone knows how to lose weight. You just need to burn more calories than you consume _over time_, and _viola_ the number on the scale starts reading lower.

Building a popular blog means writing well, _over time_, and _boom_ you're an overnight success.

Retiring well means spending less than you earn, over time, and investing wisely in boring mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that return well, consistently, _over time_ and _wham_ you're a millionaire who never even made six figures a year.

Building a movement of university students fits here too. Helping students walk with Jesus, by sharing your faith with them and teaching them to do the same, _over time_, leads to lots of people walking with Jesus and leading others to him. But it takes time.

You want an instant formula for success? Here you go.<!--more-->

Effort combined with consistency over a period of time.

It's not all the rage. It's not a sexy, overnight plan. You aren't going to hit the _New York Times'_ Bestsellers List peddling this advice. Because we already know. But we don't want to put the work in to make it happen.

So today, stop reading about the 4-hour workweek. Stop planning the conference that attracts thousands of people but doesn't lead to lasting change. Stop eating cabbage soup to detox your body.

**Start with small, hard steps. Do the boring things. Do them consistently. Do them over time.** And a year or two or twenty from now, we'll celebrate you for your novel ideas and overnight success.
