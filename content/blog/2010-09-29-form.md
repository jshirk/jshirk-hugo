**I've done things the wrong way more than once.**

I've been prone to working harder instead of working smarter. I jump in with both feet instead of assessing the situation. But, I think I'm getting better at realizing when something doesn't look or feel right.

One thing that especially pains me is watching someone else do something wrong. (and by wrong I don't mean a different way than I would do them. Wrong in the sense that they're putting _eggshells_ into their omelets instead of _yolks_.) I try to take the opportunity to help someone out when they look like they're struggling, but other times I feel I'm overstepping my bounds if I chime in out of turn. It's one thing to help when someone can't figure out the copy machine, but it's a whole different beast when you want to correct someone who doesn't think he has a problem.

More than anything, I see this at work in gyms.

**I think the weight room exemplifies the way people do things in their jobs, lives and hobbies.**

Instead of starting with something that is _appropriately challenging_, beginners end up trying to bench  300 pounds and wonder why people look at them funny when they have a barbell on their neck.

**In our lives, we often want to get things done instead of doing them right.** We rush through a project, paper, or assignment, produce garbage results, and then wonder where it all went wrong.

Next time you don't think the way you do something matters, think about these four reasons why your form is critical.

## **1. You look funny.**

When you're dropping things, knocking things over, and straining when you shouldn't have to, **it's clear to those around that it's your first rodeo.**When you aren't doing something right, you're going to embarrass yourself. Observe how others are doing things. If you find a better way, great, but don't short change your work when you think you've found a short cut.

## **2. You're wasting time.**

If you don't perform lifts properly, you might as well not do them at all. Don't try to crank out 25 reps in 15 seconds. If you don't do something right, you're going to have to redo it. It's not worth rushing through something to get it done if you're going to have to go back to it.  Take your time when you're working on projects or when you're heading to the gym. Don't rush through things. Pay attention to the details. Enjoy the experience. **Slowing down is going to save you time in the long run.**

## **3. You're gonna get hurt.**

When you're trying to lift more weight than you're able to, you're going to end up dropping it on yourself or pulling a muscle. If you're in over your head on something, doing it wrong is going to hurt.  The same is true in our work. If you think you've bitten off more than you can chew, ask for a &#8220;spot.&#8221; **Don't be afraid to seek advice when you need it. <span style="font-weight:normal;">It will </span>**save you from injuries that are tough to recover from.

## **4. Less is more.**

You're better off doing lifting at a weight you can handle and doing more of it, than trying to max out and collapse in the process. Work your way up to the big projects and tasks. Start small, build your stamina and momentum, and then continue to work your way up. **It's better to do a few things right than a bunch of things wrong.**

# So how do you fix all of these things?

_Slow down._ Ask for help. Check in with others to make sure you're on the right path. Start small, and stay after it. **You've got what it takes.**

### Your Two Cents: What areas of your life do you need to improve your form? Where did having bad form hurt you in the past?
