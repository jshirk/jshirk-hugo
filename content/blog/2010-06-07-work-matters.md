We've all had days (sometimes weeks, months, maybe even _years_) when we're drained from the work we do. We feel it doesn't matter. It seems it's not making an impact.

**Work we were once passionate about becomes work we dread.**

Things we loved doing become tiring, dull and cumbersome.

**Take heart my friends; the work you do matters.**

  <h1>
    Why Does It Matter?
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    Whether you're a janitor or the CEO of a company. If you're moving boxes or flying planes or teaching kids or blogging or just being a student, what you do matters.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here's why: <strong>because what you're doing is impacting other people</strong>. I can't think of a single isolated occupation that in some way doesn't affect other people.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    If you're an accountant, someone is relying on you for accurate numbers.<br /> A salesman? Someone is relying on you for quality service and product that solves problems.<br /> Janitor? Clean rooms.<br /> Mathematician? The fundamentals of numbers that affect our lives every day.

  <h1>
    &#8220;Seeing&#8221; The Results
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    We're not all blessed to physically see the direct results of our efforts on the people we're impacting, but here are a few lenses to look through to truly understand the fruits of your labor.
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Direct. </strong>This is the most obvious indicator of making a difference. People are impacted from your work while you're with them. You  teach a lesson or give a talk and you can see people changed. You encourage someone or uplift them through what you're doing, and it makes a noticeable difference right away. Direct interaction is the easiest way to see your work make an impact.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong> Experiential. </strong>Your work gives someone an experience. Think of the engineer who designs a roller coaster or the director who makes a movie. They might not be there when it's happening, but they can know that their work will impact people down the line. <strong>Think what the finished product of your labor means to the end consumer.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong> Indirect.</strong> This is a more difficult scenario to envision. These are the effects we often overlook. Envision a maid. Her job is to clean. There's rarely direct interaction with anyone, so it's easy to think that dusting and sweeping isn't making a difference. Now envision a traveler that's had a long week. They arrive in a spotless, organized, inviting room that was just what they needed for a pick me up. When you take pride in the work you do, even if it doesn't involve direct human interaction, you're making an impact.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong> Solutions.</strong> If you're an inventor, think of creating a product that makes life easier. Think beyond the profits, beyond the shipping and selling. Think of the end consumer, and how much easier their life is if they can find their lost dog with GPS or read a book while being covered with a blanket with sleeves. If you're a programmer, think of how much fixing a tiny, annoying glitch will impact users. When you're fixing things, no matter how small they may seem, you're solving people's problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong> Paid Forward. </strong>When the work you do has a domino effect that you can't see or envision, think of how it's helping people impact others. Just like when you hold an elevator door for someone, and that person in turn helps someone carry their groceries in, and that person helps a little old lady cross the street, and so on down the line. You have no idea what a simple seminar or sermon, a roller-coaster ride, a clean room, or a new product could do to someone. Know that when you're helping those people, they'll want to continue to spread the love. <strong>Never underestimate the power of taking pride in your work.</strong>
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Your work influences more people than you think. Don't let them down.</strong>

    Can you see the work you're doing impacting others? What other ways can you see and measure results?
