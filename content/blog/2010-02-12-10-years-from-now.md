_I want to go get a job in a profession I'm not really crazy about, suffer for eight to 10 years, and then I want to start my own business and do something I really love when I'm in a more difficult position to take chances, most likely when I have a spouse and kids._

I ask a lot of people what they want to do with their lives. Most of the people I know who are planning on pursuing a career in the business field give me a response like the one above (at least that's what I hear).

Why suffer? What makes you think you aren't prepared to start a company right now (especially if you have an idea for one)?

**We've been brainwashed into thinking corporate america is the only way, failing is the worst thing that can happen, and that if we wait to pursue our passions we'll be better off.** It's just not right.

If you have passion to help people, start a non profit. Scope out the [Pepsi Refresh project](http://refresheverything.com) to get a grant and make it happen.

If you want to start a coffee shop, talk to local owners, ask them how they did it, do your research, and work so hard you can barely stand to find someone who believes in you and has the money to make it happen.

Before you settle for a job that you won't be satisfied or challenged in, ask yourself one question: **what's keeping me from doing what I love today?**

If you love consulting, start doing it for free. Help out a local business. Add as much value as you can, and then let the word spread. Give a gift, and don't worry about the money right now. Don't quit your day job today, but take steps so that you in the future, your passion is your day job.

In 10 years, it will be too late. You'll be tired. Burnt out. Worn down from the system. You'll have a husband or a wife to take care of. A minivan full of kids to drive to soccer practice.

**Don't let the future be an excuse to settle for the status quo today.**

If you want to do what you love, it has to be today. The future is in your hands and the world is ready for change. What's stopping you?
