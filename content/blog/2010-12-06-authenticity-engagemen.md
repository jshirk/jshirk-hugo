Leaders don't exist without followers. It's like a peanut butter sandwich trying to exist without bread. A zoo existing without animals. Northeast Ohio without snow. It's simply not possible.

So how do you attract more followers (the real life kind, most importantly, but inevitably the Twitter kind too)?

**Authenticity and Engagement.**

  Don't be afraid of who you are. Whoever you are, wherever your from, there are people who want to know the real you. Not everyone will give you a chance, and that's their loss. People crave authentic, engaging leaders.

## The Two Keys

1. **Authenticity**  
Don't hide who you are. Don't be embarrassed by your interests. Don't conform to a mold because you think that's what leaders are supposed to look like. Don't tweet about sports if you don't care about sports. We can see right through it when you tell us someone just kicked a touchdown.

It's clear when people are putting on an act. Be who you were created to be. Embrace your passion for stamp collecting or your obsession with scrapbooking. **There is no normal.** 

****But there is a huge problem with trying to be what other people consider normal at the cost of your sincerity and authenticity.

Do what you love. Lead people who are interested in what you're interested in. They need you.

2. **Engagement**

****You can't be a leader without followers. You won't have followers if they don't know who you are.

When people reach out to you, you must respond. You have to comment when they say something interesting, you have to encourage when they do something spectacular.

You are not bigger or better than anyone else. You have a unique platform and opportunity, but ignoring (or, perhaps, ignorance) is not an option.

Engage people. Meet with them. Message them. Build them up. Show them the benefits of trudging forward and of being unique.

People are out there. They want to be led.

**Be real. Be there.**
