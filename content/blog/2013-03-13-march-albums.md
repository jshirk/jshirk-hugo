I like making my ears happy. You may enjoy making your ears happy too. Here's my (eclectic) mix of what's on my digital turntable, bringing sweet joy to all who listen. Click the album images for a link to Amazon MP3s.

## Zion &#8211; Hillsong United

I've always preferred Hillsong United's studio albums (like _Aftermath) _to their live albums. My current go-to worship album. A more electronic sound than usual (even for them), but enjoyable nonetheless.

**Four word review:** Christocenteric electronic extended worship.

**Favorite tracks:** _Stay and Wait_ and _Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)_

## **Weight & Glory &#8211; KB**

A partner in the 116 Clique with Lecrae, KB rapped on a handful of other singles (_Used to Do It Too _from Lecrae's _Rehab_ and _One Sixteen from_ Trip Lee's _The Good Life_, to name a few favorite), but his album goes far beyond that. The more I listen to it, the more I love each song.

**Four-word review: **Ridiculous beats praising Jesus.

**Favorite tracks:** _Anomaly_** **and _Church Clap_

## An Awesome Wave &#8211; alt-J

One of my favorite Alternative albums from last year. This is alt-J's debut album, and I hope this quartet has many  to come. Great music to work to, but be ready for the lyrics to be lodged in your skull. Sounds a bit like Jack Johnson and an unknown indie band had a baby with harder to distinguish lyrics and more instruments.

**Four-word(ish) review**: Indie-philosophy lyrics, alteran-awesome hooks.

******Favorite tracks**: _Taro_ and _Breezeblocks_

## Every Kingdom &#8211; Ben Howard

****Beware of this album: it will make you wish it was summertime in a heartbeat. Great voice accompanied with smooth tempo changes and lyrical craftsmanship leads to a fabulous debut studio album by this British singer-songwriter.

**Four-word review: **Mello sound, catchy flow

**Favorite tracks**: _Old Pine _and _Only Love_

## Myth &#8211; Geographer

Another indie album that I tried to play to death but couldn't. Funky sounds and synth currents. Fun, entertaining and easy on the ears. May lead to foot tapping and air-synth playing.

**Four-word review:** Layered brilliance with heart

**Favorite tracks**: _Kites_ and _Vesijärvi_
