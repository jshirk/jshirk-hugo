I’ve officially decided to dub this week, the final sevenish days of August “Friendship Week” at The Point of Impact. As I looked back at the friendships made and enhanced this summer and look forward to those I’ll be continuing at home and in Athens soon, I thought the idea was fitting.  If you disagree, start your own blog and make up your own week.

Last night, I had a chance to meet up with a fellow Akronite here in Columbus. It’s always refreshing to enjoy the company of a guy like Aaron Golby who shares a love for the Lord and the [330](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_330) like few others.  People always ask me, “What’s so awesome about [Akron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio)?  Everyone from there always talks about how great it is.” Home of [LeBron James](http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie/post/Photos-LeBron-James-King-for-Kids-charity-bi?urn=nba,184682).  Rubber Capital of the World.  [Bridgestone Invitational](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgestone_Invitational).  [Luigi's](http://luigisrestaurant.com/Welcome_To_Luigis_Restaurant,_Akron_Ohio.html).  [The Roo](http://www.feartheroo.net/) at [The U](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Akron).  Outside of those things—it’s intangible.

At any rate, during our discussion last night, Aaron **dared** me to do something.  He dared me to go on a mission’s trip next summer.  When it comes to dares, I’m a bit like [Marty McFly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_McFly) when somebody calls him chicken—I lose self-control and refuse to let it go.  It was a powerful challenge, and one I plan to prayerfully consider.

To say I was merely encouraged by Aaron's dare would be a gross understatement.  You see, when you begin building close, personal relationships, your friends will see your potential.  They will see your growth.  They will challenge you to do things you may not have considered before.  **Your finest friends are the ones who push you to be a better you.** 

We live in a society that wants nothing to do with accountability.  We want to do our own thing and have everyone mind their own business. Put up walls.  Fake relationships.  Live a compartmentalized life where some people consider you a saint and others trust you as far as they can throw you. We think it’s easier to live a life with no transparency where no one knows you, and you hardly recognize yourself when you look in the mirror.

I’ve been there.  _I have lived that life_.  I’ve built walls and refused to let people in.  And do you know what I’ve found?  That’s not true friendship.  That is _garbage_.  That’s camaraderie phonier than a handbag in Chinatown.  **You will not have meaningful relationships if you don't get vulnerable**.

Be willing to share your mistakes and regrets.  Learn from your slip-ups and mishaps. We’re human—we’re supposed to screw up.  Grow together.  Lift each other up.  As [Dwayne Wade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80dQekTAmIE) (and the ancient Japanese proverb) says, “Fall down seven. Stand up eight.”

I challenge you to let people know the _real_ you.  There is nothing better than a genuine friend.  Give me a friend who has screwed up and seemingly disappointed those around him countless times but is honest about his mistakes and is willing to open up any day.  As for the person who fakes their way through life, trying to come out smelling like roses without learning from the past, press the reset button and then come talk to me.

You can have water-cooler conversations for the rest of your life without letting someone in.  Or, you can build a community of fellowship—a brotherhood admired by those who see it at work.  Let people in. Challenge your friends to do great things.  I **dare** you.
