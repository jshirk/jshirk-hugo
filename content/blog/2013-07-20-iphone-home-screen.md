  I write about the apps I use really frequently (I need to justify owning an iPhone <em>somehow</em>).
</p>

I recently discovered [MacSparky](http://macsparky.com), David Sparks' website. He often highlights the home screens of his friends' iPhones, and since I don't have any friends, I decided to write about my own home screen.

My home screen is in constant flux. I've moved the icons around a dozen times in the last week since being back in the States (_au revoir_, MagicJack and Ljubljana Bus app). It was time to get all efficient.

I normally sell you on why I love apps, but this is more on how I use them and my general iOS workflow instead of just great apps. I've been thinking a lot about workflow lately thanks to the [Mac Power Users](http://5by5.tv/mpu/) podcast (by David Sparks and Katie Floyd) and my incessant urge to be ever more productive and efficient.<!--more-->

## The Writing Stuff

[Evernote](http://evernote.com), [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com) and [Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074&at=11l4uN). Yes, I still love Evernote. Yes, I still use it every day. Yes, I just ordered the [Evernote Moleskine](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8866137626/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=8866137626&linkCode=as2&tag=thepoiofimp-20) to get 3-months of premium Evernote to give the upgraded service a test-run. (I _needed_ a small pocket journal for ideas, to-do lists, etc. and since it's $15 for 3-months of pay-per-month Evernote premium, an extra couple bucks for the journal just made sense).

I just started using Day One, but I like the idea of keeping a journal. I often journal prayers and passage from the Bible, but rarely life's day-to-day happenings. It's good for me to track how I was feeling, what I was experiencing and how I'm growing in my faith. Not to mention, the Day One app is a pleasure to use and I've configured it to remind me to update each day (because I'm very forgetful).

Drafts is a really slick app. It's a super quick way to take notes, but it's much more than that. It links with dozens of other apps and actions, so you can write a note and send yourself an email, send a to-do to Clear, add a tweet to Buffer, save a note to Evernote, post to Facebook, send a group text to a custom group&#8211;tons of things. I'm still getting the hang of it, but it's a one-stop shop for text input and dishing it where it needs to go. **Drafts is the new point guard on my iPhone.**

## The Social Stuff

I use [Tweetbot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter-iphone/id428851691&at=11l4uN) (oft-mentioned, still my favorite), but I deleted it for a time to cut back on my Twitter usage. That worked, because the mobile Twitter website is so painful to use it was never worth checking (for example: tapping the top of the screen doesn't scroll to top like every other website and app. _What the what?_).

I use [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/iphone/) to scour my Feedly RSS list. I switched from Feedly because I was constantly having to log in on the app and I couldn't save articles that were linked in the blog posts to Instapaper. I don't have to log in every time I open the app and Reeder is just plain cleaner. Much easier to navigate and save things for later. It's also free.

**I'm still trying to find a perfect calendar solution, so if you have a favorite app, please share!** Right now I'm using [Cue](http://cueup.com), which is mostly a data search aggregator that searches all of your services (Dropbox, Facebook, Google, etc), but it also has the best calendar for my needs. Ideally, I want a calendar to show me when I have events at a monthly glance (i.e. which days are my most open, which are busiest) and the other options are lacking in my opinion. Cue shows a little square for each event for each day. It's simple and effective.

In the midst of trying to find a good calendar, I've downloaded a handful of craptastic calendar apps and every event alert makes my iPhone rumble like it's getting ready for lift off because of the plethora of calendars. I ended up deleting my calendar from the primary Apple Calendar, and I'm just using Cue now. I'd like to have a desktop app, but for now I'm just sticking with Google Calendar.

I'm still using the excellent [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com) for email. I'm actually using email on my iPhone more often than my laptop because of the amazing delay feature for emails that Mailbox offers. Having emails return to your inbox at a later date should be custom baked into Gmail (and I know Boomerang does that, but I want it to be native, ok?).

## The Tracking Stuff

I'm on a new lifestyle eating plan (some call them _diets_, but diets don't work, so lifestyle eating plan it is) and it requires me to eat a certain percentage of fat, carbs and protein each day. [Lose It!](http://www.loseit.com) is the perfect app for that. You can also scan barcodes to automatically input nutrition data and it has a lot of chain restaurants included in the database. **I absolutely love this app.** It's clean, easy to use, and completely eye-opening in a scary kind of way as far as what you're eating.

[1Password][12] is a lifesaver. I pulled the trigger for the desktop, iPad and iPhone versions, and I haven't looked back. _All of my passwords are now completely unrecognizable._ I can't log in to Facebook or Twitter without 1Password because it's a crazy string of numbers and letters&#8211;but now I have different passwords for all of my services. It's safer that way, and I'm totally unattached to my passwords, so I can change them every few months for added security. It's impossible to be hack-proof, but the wall is a little higher now. Also, 1Password can autosave your payment information, which is great when shopping online.

I'm giving [Clear](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clear/id493136154?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l4uN) another run for my to-do list manager. I really like the interface and if I get comfy enough I'll snag the desktop version. I was using Evernote for my to-do needs before, but it was slow to sync at times and gave me half-finished lists when I was switching between devices.

We are taking advantage of our free 1-month trial of Amazon Prime and we're sold all over again on it's value. With free Prime Instant Video and two-day shipping, it's a no brainer for us to pull the trigger on the $80/year subscription once our month is up. I've ordered something nearly every day from the app (because we _needed_ it, _really_) and it's saved us probably close to the $80 we'll pay next month already. The app is perfect, and I'm constantly scanning things in stores to see if it's cheaper on Amazon.

## The Boring Stuff

The App Store, Camera and Settings icons, stock apps, hang out on the home screen because: 1. I like to have all my apps up to date 2. I snap pictures pretty regularly (especially of library book pages I want to remember) 3. I'm constantly turning Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on and off to sync with my Fitbit.

## Question: What's on your home screen? I'd love to have you share a link to a screenshot in the comments.
