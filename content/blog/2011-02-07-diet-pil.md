## Results show that over thirty days with no change in diet and no exercise you can lose 20 pounds!

What a delight! All we have to do is take a pill, make no changes in our life, and we can lose weight. Sign me up!

Whether or not the claims we hear each day from every direction of the media are true, I think it highlights a problem much larger than obesity in our culture.

We want things to change _without having to sacrifice anything._

We want to lose weight but eat all the Twinkies we want.  
We want to fix our relationships but we don't want to turn off the TV and truly communicate.  
We want a job we love without having to do anything more than submit a resume online.  
 **We want to go to heaven but we don't want to stop living for hell.**

We have been inundated with laziness and apathy thanks to everyone from infomercials to Disney. We want to do what we've always done but achieve different results (some say that's the definition of insanity) because that's what we hear everyone else is doing.

No sacrifice. No change. No problem.

**Take a pill; fix your life.**

My friends, there is no diet pill for your life. **There is no change without sacrifice.**

If you want to lose weight, you need to die to your old diet and laziness.  
If you want to repair broken relationships, you need to die to yourself and put others' needs above your own.  
If you want a job you love, you need to die to the old way of doing things and create value that no one else can.  
If you want to go to heaven, you need to die to your sin through the saving grace of Jesus Christ.

There are no shortcuts to change. There are no life-changing pills. You have to die to your old ways if you want to live differently.
