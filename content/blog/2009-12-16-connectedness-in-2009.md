This blog post is the first of its kind for The Point of Impact.

I'm writing it on my iPhone.

On a plane.

In flight.

Technology today has surpassed what most of us could have ever imagined. We are connected everywhere, all the time, nonstop.

Not only can we have technology everwhere all the time, but we are able to connect with others everywhere all the time.

I could call a friend overseas on this flight or text a friend at home and tell him our flight is on time.

Even more impressive is the ability to find answers.

One of my &#8220;friends&#8221; (and I use that term on Facebook loosely) posted a status update with the lyrics of a song. Moments later, someone asked the name of the song. A third party then chimed in and responded with the song title.

But that's not what's impressive. What's impressive is that it all in a matter of seconds.

What we have is a gift&#8211;a toolbox of opportunities to leverage information and communication.

Innovations will not stop. Connectedness will continue indefinitely. The world is shrinking, and if you're a person with ideas, that's the best news you'll hear all week.

Buckle your seatbelts, my friends. There are no emergency exits in this intertwined world. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the future.
