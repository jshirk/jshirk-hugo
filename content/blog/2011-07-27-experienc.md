> “I would probably believe in God if he showed himself to me. Or if I had a near death experience and had some vision. If he came down to me and said, &#8216;I am God. Believe in me.' Then I would start believing”

In my encounters, visions and near death experiences top the charts in what it would take for those who don’t believe in God to place their faith in Him.

I understand where they’re coming from. They need some proof. They need an experience. Just like you need to drink a cup of the World’s Best Coffee to believe it’s the real deal.

It’s an awfully selfish request. It’s framed in a way implying God owes us something—as if we deserve to hear from him in a way we decide. That God should erase our need for faith in order to embrace Him.

To those who have never experienced God: Don’t limit experiencing Him to near death experiences and angelic visions. God rarely shows up in the form of a burning bush or audible voice.

**It’s not impossible, it’s just unlikely.**

But that doesn’t mean you don’t have opportunities to experience Him.

Maybe you’ve had nothing but hardships, seen nothing but hypocrites who claim to be Christians, and the closest you’ve come to experiencing God is hearing a Fray song at the bar.

Don’t give up. God is alive. He is here. You just haven’t experienced Him yet.

If you’re asking why God hasn’t visibly appeared or audibly spoken to you, you’re asking the wrong question. You need to ask, If I want to experience God, where is the most likely place for that to happen?

**You haven't experienced God because you haven't put yourself (and your heart) in a place to experience Him.**

You may not like to hear it, but God promises to show up where two or more are gathered in His name ([Matthew 18:20](http://bib.ly/Mt18.20.ESV))—making a church that has a pastor and at least one person in attendance a good start. God also promises to draw near to those who draw near to Him ([James 4:8](http://bib.ly/Jm4.8.ESV)). Have you gathered in His name? Have you tried to draw near to Him through reading the Bible or praying to Him?

**God can show up at a bar, but chances are it is going to be hard to hear Him there.**

God can show up in a vision, but He’s already showed up in the flesh, in the form of His son, Jesus Christ. He could speak audibly to you, or He could write you a whole book, the longest love letter ever written, in the form of the Bible.

**Don’t limit how you can experience a limitless God.** Put yourself in a position to experience Him in places He promises to be.
