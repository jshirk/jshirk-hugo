In the world of work, everyone chastises procrastinators.[tweetmeme source=”jshirk.com” only_single=false http://jshirkman.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/http://jshirkman.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/procrastination-isnt-a-dirty-word/]They're lazy. They wait until the last minute. They put things off. They're the ones stapling the paper, adding the last image to the PowerPoint, or making that phone call seconds before the deadline.

**But if they get it done…does it matter?** The person who finishes something weeks ahead of time and the person who finishes it just in time, if the quality of work is the same, are no different. They finished the job. They met the deadline. They shipped. Now tell me, where's the issue?

I believe there's a negative connotation with the word, and I'm here to debunk it. **For me, procrastination is more or less more effective time management.** At the 11th hour, I don't have any choice but to make things happen. I can't tweet, browse Facebook, or read more blogs. I have to do the work. I don't stress about it, I just do it.

I don't miss deadlines. If I say I'm going to do something, I do it. But, by all common definitions of the word, I'm a procrastinator.

Webster says this about procrastinating:

> to put off intentionally and habitually  
> _or_  
> to put off intentionally the doing of something that should be done

**Intentionally putting something off. That** _**has**_ **to be bad.**

But hold on, let's look at an example. Say I have procrastinated and haven't finished a paper that's due tomorrow afternoon. Then, a friend I haven't seen in quite some time comes to town unexpectedly. Realizing what's more important, I quickly decide to intentionally put off my work until tomorrow when I'll still have time to get it done.

Is that wrong?

Ok, how about more insight on the word. Wikipedia tells me:

> The word itself comes from the Latin word procrastinatus: pro- (forward) and crastinus (of tomorrow)

**Forward tomorrow**. That doesn't sound so bad. As long as you're moving in the right direction, is it so bad if it's tomorrow?

Personally, I work better under pressure. When I know the deadline is looming, I get a boost of energy, focus, and drive.

**Procrastination isn't a dirty word.** It's a different approach. It might not be for you, it's certainly not to be abused, but it is far from a bad thing.
