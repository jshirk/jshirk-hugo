Happy Thanksgiving, my friends. I could easily make a list as long as a Black Friday line at Best Buy rattling off things I’m thankful for, but I write about them every post.

Today, my thanks goes out to you, the readers, because I would have been burnt out long ago if it wasn’t for your encouragement and support.

Count your blessings today. Be thankful for all you have and forget about what you think you’re missing.

Thanks for giving me a huge blessing to be thankful for this year.

You keep reading, and I’ll keep writing.
