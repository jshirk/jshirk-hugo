The Dollar Shave Club commercial intrigued many. [Warning: some strong language bleeped out and one unbleeped dirty word].



It's hilarious. Ridiculous. Completely over the top and worth talking about. As Seth Godin would say, it's remarkable.

I was tired of paying over $3 per cartridge (and many times closer to $4) for a 5-blade Gillette Fusion razor. It's expensive because they market the Fusion as if it is the only solution to caveman-like beards. **Guys, it's not! It's not the only way!**

Enter our friends from [Dollar Shave Club](http://shaved.by/feXw). Their marketing alone sold me on the worthiness of trying it, at least for a month. This is a comprehensive Dollar Shave Club review in every sense of the word, so grab tightly to your can of shaving solution and get ready to nix your neck hair.

_(Here's a quick synopsis of my Dollar Shave Club review: it rocks. Their blades rock, their service rocks, and I'm a believer. If you want to buy your next razor from them right now, here's an [affiliate link](http://shaved.by/feXw) that gets me a month of free razors and will help keep my blog afloat as a nice little razor subsidy for me. If you want the full analysis, read on. Also, there's a hefty amount of comparisons between the DSC razor and the Gillette Fusion because everybody and their mother has the Fusion. It was also my last brand-named, overpriced razor.)_

## The Dollar Shave Club Blade Options

Upon your decision to test the DSC waters, you have three disposable razor options. I went with the 4x that costs $6 per month. I nixed The Humble Twin because shaving with two blades is pre-historic, but $9 a month for the Executive seemed too steep. I decided I didn't need the extra backside trimming blade, because I pretty much always cut myself with it on the Fusion. So, the 4x aka &#8220;The Lover's Blade&#8221; was the Goldilocks. And, _spoiler alert_, it's pretty much perfect.

## The Packaging

Each month DSC sends a confirmation email letting you know when your blades will ship (which is nice if you realize you want to switch to the every other month plan if you need fewer than 4-blades per month). The package arrives via USPS and took about three days to get to me in Northeast Ohio. It comes in a package that looks like this.

## The Razor Handle

Your first handle is free, which is great. This thing is heavy in a good way. Easy to grip, a really nice weight (much more solid feeling than the Fusion handle) and it's a fancy white color. _Ooooh. Ahhhh._

One bummer&#8211;it's a little tricky to get the blades swapped out. You have to push much harder than you do on the Fusion. The good news is you know your blade is definitely locked in there.

Niki and I shared a handle and would swap our blades back and forth. We were switching blades much more regularly than an average user who is only swapping blades when they wear out. Again, not a huge deal, just a note.

This month I spoiled my wife (read: I stopped being cheap) and I purchased an extra handle, which is super easy to do on the DSC website. It's only $4 for an extra handle and they send it with your next round of blades.

## The Blades

They last much longer than I anticipated. I shave every 2 &#8211; 3 days and I can use one blade for 2 &#8211; 3 weeks. Unlike the Fusion, the lubricated strip doesn't wear down and break apart easily. **The shave isn't as close as the Fusion. It's close enough for me though.** If you have a job where you need a super close shave and you have face hair that grows like weeds juiced with Miracle-Gro, these blades might not be ideal for you (or you're going to need to shave twice a day).

Obviously, using shaving cream makes the blades last even longer. They sent a free trial of Shave Butter. _It sucks._ **I repeat: don't buy the Shave Butter.** I like to rock the old-school $1 can of Barbasol (which has a great new logo design. _Way to go, Team Barbasol. Welcome to the late 90s!_)

**A quick razor blade PSA.** I used to have this bad habit of slamming the razor against the sink to get the hair out, until I realized the blades were bending, because, you know _they weren't meant to be slammed_. Now I just shake it out ([Florence + the Machine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbN0nX61rIs) style) under running water and the lifeless hair particles leap out with great joy.

I've noticed hair doesn't stick in the blade like it does with the Fusion (man, this post is becoming a real Fusion smack down. _Take that, P&G!_ That's for that one summer when you didn't accept me to be an intern!) which is an extra bonus.

## The Final Dollar Shave Club Review Question–Is It Worth It?

**Yes. Yes. $6-a-month yes. I'm sold.**

The quality in most areas (handle quality, blade longevity) is better than an average disposable razor (outside of closeness in shave, not super important to me) and the price is _way_ better at $1.50 a cartridge. This will likely save us $70+ a year on razors.

## A Few Last Notes

Lifehacker noted that you can buy the razor and the blades [here](http://www.dorcousa.com), from Dorco, the company that makes the razors DSC ships out.

**I honestly think DSC is still worth it.** No upfront costs of stocking up, the convenience of not having to buy more blades because you're refilled once a month, and _I just want these guys to make it_. Also, you can't buy an extra handle from Dorco on its own, so another reason DSC is worth it in our situation. I also love mail. Another DSC win!

**If you change your mind about DSC, it's super easy to cancel once you login to your account.** I read somewhere online (this place _can't_ be trusted!) that it was difficult to cancel. Not true.

Also, they send you another free handle if you upgrade or downgrade to the $3 or $9 a month plan.

You won't find any Dollar Shave Club coupon codes (it's $6 a month, people!), but for every friend you refer, you get a month of free razors. Talk about a deal. So, hook up your friend by [signing up for DSC right here.](http://shaved.by/feXw)
