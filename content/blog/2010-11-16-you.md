The word _you_ got you here. _You_ want to know about the big problem _you_ have. It's interesting that you thought I was talking about _you_ specifically.

## The Big You Problem

I always turn around when I hear my name. It's a reflex I'll never shake.  
<!--more-->

  
But I rarely  respond when someone says, &#8220;Hey, you!&#8221;

That's what spam does. The same is true for telemarketing. And when the professor asks an open question to the class.

#### All of those channels throw out a massive plea for action and pray at least **one person** will respond.

In those cases, _you_ don't take have to take action. **_You_ could be anybody.** The word you is rationalized and reasoned away from being _you_ [that is, the human reading this].

If I called you by name, you would probably listen. Unfortunately, I can't.

That's the problem with blogs. The channel is impersonal. People respond don't respond because they don't have to.

In a face-to-face, one-on-one conversation with you, it's hard to ignore me when I ask you a question. But when the question is posed to the world [or blogosphere, or class, or group, or individuals numbering more than 1], you think, &#8220;He isn't talking to me. Someone else will respond. I don't have to take action.&#8221;

#### Right now, though, **I'm talking to you**.

## Setting _You_ Straight

I'm asking **you** to take action. You. The Reader. **The one with your eyes on the page right this second**. I wish I could call you by name, but blogs limit personal greetings.

Don't be another person in the crowd that ignores the call. Don't pretend you aren't responsible.

It reminds me of the situations when someone passes out and a crowd of people gather around. One person yells out,

#### &#8220;Somebody call 9-1-1!&#8221;

**But no one does.**

You think,

#### &#8220;It's not me she's asking to call. It's the guy next to me. Or the girl on the other side of the circle. She'll call. She's a good citizen. I see her on her iPhone right now.&#8221;

And everyone else proceeds with the same thought. **The ambulance doesn't come because you have rationalized away the call to you.**

Few people comment on blogs. I'd guess even fewer take action after reading a post [but they'll probably tweet it to their friends and post it to their Facebook].

Start taking action. Stop ignoring the call to you.

You have a chance to respond. To take action. To make a difference. You are the one I'm talking to.

## What I'm Asking of You

As of Tuesday, November 16 at 8:12am, 39 people have [donated to bring clean water](http://mycharitywater.org/jshirk) to a developing nation. They knew I was talking to them when I said &#8220;you&#8221;.

**Now I'm asking you. The reader. Not someone else. Not the next person to read this or the person before you. I'm. Asking. You.**

To those of you who have donated already and shared the link with your friends and family, thank you. I'm incredibly grateful for your response.

To those of you still reading, still waiting for a personal invitation: here it is.

## Will _you_ help save lives?

**[For more information about donating to help people dying every day due to a lack of clean water, check out the posts [here](http://jshirkman.wordpress.com/2010/11/01/water/) and [here](http://jshirkman.wordpress.com/2010/11/04/faq/) and [donate here](http://mycharitywater.org/jshirk).]**
