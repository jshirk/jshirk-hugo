No one goes skydiving without going through training. It's mandatory, it's essential and it'd be pretty foolish to launch out of a moving aircraft without knowing what you're doing.

Employers that have a high emphasis on training have a high value on effectiveness, efficiency and keeping their employees. If your organization doesn't &#8220;believe in&#8221; training, that should be a red flag.

Here's why training is essential for success. <!--more-->

### 1. You get to learn from others' mistakes.

Many times, training bubbles up out of necessity. Organizations have seen where others have failed in the past, and they use that as a springboard for training future recruits. Failure is a great teacher, but the foresight of learning from other people's failures is less costly and just as effective.

### 2. You struggle on the things that matter.

Struggling is good. It helps you grow, develop and overcome. But struggling on insignificant things is a waste of time. Struggling to find an option in the software you use, the phone number for your boss or how to set up direct deposit is poor stewardship. Struggle to solve big problems, not easy fixes when others already have the answers.

### 3. You're mutually invested.

When your employer provides training, it shows they want you to be well equipped–they want you to succeed. When you go through a training and do the work that's required, you show you're serious about being effective. It takes time, money and effort, but it will ultimately save all three many times over.

### 4. You have increased clarity.

Your role should be clearly defined through training, so you know what should and shouldn't be your focus. One of the greatest crimes in today's work is doing things that _don't_ matter. Even if you do them excellently, no one wins.

### 5. You get your feet wet before diving in.

You have the opportunity to ask questions, get familiar with your work and be prepared before you start. That gives you a huge head start once it's actually time to begin.

### 6. You have proper perspective.

It's amazing what training will do, especially when an organization focuses on the _why_ behind the _what_. Perspective changes everything. Seeing yourself as a vital link between customers and employees instead of just an administrative assistant pushing papers, you'll do your work with more joy and purpose.

Training applies in situations outside of work as well. Investing some cash in learning a new hobby or skill is worth it. **You can always make more money but you can't make more time.** Consider investing in yourself to grow–it has a guaranteed return.
