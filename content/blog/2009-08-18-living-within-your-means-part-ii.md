‘Tis better to give than to receive. I know, it's not Christmas, but this tiny nugget of truth resonates no matter what time of year it is. We’ve all heard it, but we’re not all sure about it. With the credit crunch, piling debt, and the cost of living continuing to increase, we feel we have less to give than ever before. We can’t possibly spare any money to give to our church or to charities. Can we afford to buy a friend’s lunch? Unlikely—we can hardly afford our own.

As I mentioned [yesterday](http://jshirkman.wordpress.com/2009/08/17/living-within-your-means-part-i/), I’ve been tracking my spending this summer with the combination of a good ol’ spreadsheet and the feature-rich [Mint.com](http://www.mint.com). I found that I spend a lot of money on things I don’t necessarily need. New shirts. New books. New things I could very easily go without. I’m not in debt, my accounts are all in the black, but that doesn’t mean I’ve been managing my assets wisely.

This summer, I found I spend too much money on things I don’t need, and I spend it on myself. I’m selfish, and my spending habits have validated that. I’m making a commitment to spending more on the people I care about, and those I want to make an impact on. I’ve got more than I could ever want, and I want to bless others in the same way that I have been blessed. I'm certainly not giving until it hurts. I don't even give until it tickles a little. I give out of convenience rather than sacrifice. I've regretted new purchases for myself plenty of times, but I've never thought, &#8220;I shouldn't have paid for so-and-so's meal.&#8221; or &#8220;They didn't deserve that gift.&#8221;

We’re so quick to think that we don’t have money to spare. It’s ours. We earned it. We _deserve_ to spend it on ourselves. I personally believe that every single dime I’ve been blessed with comes straight from the good Lord, so anything I have isn’t even mine to begin with. I’m not saying that we shouldn’t be entitled to treating ourselves every once and a while. What I am saying that we are the richest nation in the world, but we act like we’re a stone-throw away from poverty.

If you’re in debt, your first priority should be to get out of it.  We should be helping others with what we’ve been given, but we can’t help anyone if we’re filing for bankruptcy. Cut back your spending. Live with only the necessities for a while. If you’re in a position to spend money on movie tickets, sporting events, and iPhone Apps, you have the money to give to those around you. You have no idea how much people appreciate something as simple as buying them a gift to say you appreciate them or splurging to buy a stamp to send them a card.

I encourage you to pick up the tab for a friend when you go out to eat, or buy a book for someone you know would enjoy it. Don’t expect anything in return. Give out of love. Give to show you care about someone else and because you’ve been given the resources to do so. The little things in life leave a lasting impression on people. It’s amazing how far you can stretch a dollar when you spend it on someone else.
