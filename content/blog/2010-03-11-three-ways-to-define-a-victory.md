**They say winning isn’t everything. I completely disagree.**

If you aren’t winning, then you’re losing. And from my experience and deep amount of research: No one likes to lose.

Can you learn from it? Sure. But a “loss” isn’t always a loss&#8211;many times it's just a situation needing redefined.

So let’s clearly define a victory to clear up the confusion of losing.

There are three ways I see in defining a win:

**1. Direct Victory**—Taking the gold medal, winning the blue ribbon, hitting the game winning jump shot to beat the other team. It’s the most obvious type of victory. It’s the one everyone talks about at the water cooler. The one that gets you on the front page, the interview on The Today Show, and the Gatorade bath.It’s a great feeling. It’s the win we’re always chasing. It isn’t, however, always the most important or the most rewarding. It is, however, the type of victory that’s most talked obvious.

**2. Moral Victory**—It’s the extreme underdog playing their hearts out against the perennial powerhouse, not making a single mistake but just not having enough “umph” to get it done. You play a flawless game, give 110% and still come up short. You did your best, you wouldn’t change a thing about your approach, you get an A for effort. Maybe you didn’t get a chance to climb to the top of the podium, but you exceeded expectations. You went further than anyone thought you would, you gave it your all and you deserve more than a pat on the back.  Pick your head up, get that dirt off your shoulder, and keep at it. You did your thing—no one can take that away from you.

**3. Alternative Victory**—Here’s one that may not be the result of your average game. Let’s take a look at something like the [National Collegiate Sales Competition](http://coles.kennesaw.edu/ncsc/). Your first goal is to win. You’re going to do everything in your power to make that happen. But there are too many external factors to see not walking away with a big fat plaque with your name on it as a loss.If you met great people—_that’s a victory_. If you networked with companies that are going to sponsor your sales program—_that’s a victory_. If you bonded with your team—_that’s a victory_. If you personally developed through the experience—_that’s a victory_.These aren’t the direct championships anyone ever talks about, but here’s the catch: ten years from now, when you ask someone who won the championship, a handful will remember. When you ask someone about the people met, the opportunities that appeared, the bonding that occurred, and the pivotal moment of exponential personal growth, that is something that you never forget.

Don’t settle for a loss. **Just find the victory.**  
_Your thoughts: what are alternative victories you already look for? Are there any other types of victories that don't fit into_ _these categories?_
