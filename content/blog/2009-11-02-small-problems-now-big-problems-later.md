This morning I made a terrible decision.

I was in a rush to get to the gym because I had a lot of things I wanted to accomplish this morning (like writing a blog post).

I went out to my car and realized there was frost coating the windows. I didn’t have a scraper, so I proceeded to put roll down my windows, blast the heater, and spray the windshield with washer fluid as I drove.

I ended up leaning my head out of the window to see where I was going, gasping for breath as the cold air berated my face.<!--more-->

The drive was under a mile, but my decision was 100 percent unjustified. It was a flat out stupid choice.

I arrived at my destination safely, but why would I risk my life (and most certainly others) because I was in too big of a hurry to walk or clean off my windows?

**I did it because I was too lazy, too rushed, and too stubborn to take the time and effort to make sure I could clearly see where I was going.**

Instead of taking time to ensure the safety of others and myself, I chose to look like an idiot with my head hanging out of my driver’s side window, driving 15 mph under the speed limit because I could barely see.

Unfortunately, this isn’t the only case of irrational behavior for me. **Too often I let tiny things that can lead to monster problems get in the way of where I’m going.**

I let miniscule disagreements eat away at friendships. I push a minor problem under the rug that will most certainly lead to huge complications instead of easily taking care of it and ensuring a smoother ride in the future.

What are the trivial issues that lead to enormous problems in your life?

**Don’t be too bullheaded, ignorant, or tired to handle a petite problem that is right in front of you**—a problem that is going to affect you much too deep in comparison to the magnitude of the problem.

Apologize to a friend if your relationship has been damaged over something minor (or even something major). Take care of that speed bump in your life that is blurring your vision, holding you back, and keeping you from where you are going before it turns into a roadblock in the future.

 ****

**Don’t let a quick fix turn into a huge regret.** Take the time today to resolve a nagging problem, something that is obscuring your view, so that you can clearly see what lies ahead.
