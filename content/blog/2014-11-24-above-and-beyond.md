Four years ago I created a [charity: water campaign](http://mycharitywater.org/jshirk) for my birthday to raise money to build a well to provide clean water for people who didn’t have access to the most basic need in life.

Through the generosity of friends, family, blog readers, and maybe even you, we raised $5,004 and helped build a few wells in Africa. If you’re curious, here’s an [infographic](https://jshirk.com/blog/charity-water-update-infographic/) I made about the project.

For the last three years, the remarkable team at charity: water has wished me a happy birthday–the first year through a YouTube video, then via phone calls the last two years.

There are celebrities and superstars who partner with charity: water. Projects raise far more than mine. And yet they’ve gone out of their way to say thanks over and over and over again.

I don’t have a new charity: water campaign running, but I think it’d be awesome if you did. [Start a campaign](https://my.charitywater.org/p/signin) or [donate](http://mycharitywater.org/jshirk) by providing water this holiday season. The folks a charity: water won’t be the only ones who are grateful.

I have a lot to learn about gratitude to charity: water, and I don't think we can underestimate the power of a genuine thank you, especially one for something that seems almost too old to say thanks for.
