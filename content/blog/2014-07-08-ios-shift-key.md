The iPhone is my most frequently used computer.

I use it dozens of times each day, and I’m a fan of the iOS 7 operating system.

But, one huge step backwards was trying to discern whether the shift key is on (i.e. making the first letter a capital) or off. It was so bad, someone made a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/iOSShiftKey) mocking it.

But, today I offer a solution for us all to know if shift is _enabled_ or _disabled_.

Since all of the letter keys on the iPhone keyboard are displayed as capital letters, just ask yourself,

> ## “Does the shift key look like the rest of the keyboard?”

**If yes, (as in a white background with a black outline inside the key, as the letters have) shift is ENABLED / ON.**

**If no, (as in a grey background with a white outline inside the key, different than how the keyboard appears) shift is DISABLED /OFF.**

Apple should fix this poor design, but in the meantime just remember–if it looks the same, it will display the letter just as it is–capitalized.
