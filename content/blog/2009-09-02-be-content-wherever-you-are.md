I have been blessed to be surrounded with absolutely incredible, Grade A, fantastic people in every city I’ve been in over the past year.  Today, I’m saying goodbye (for about the 20<sup>th</sup> time) to those I’ve known the longest.

After a whirlwind adventure from Athens to Columbus to Akron, I’m going back…_home_.  It’s true—there’s no use in pretending any longer.  My home is in Athens, but don’t think my heart isn’t still in The Rubber (and also the Capital) City.

I can’t even put into words how excited I am to get back to Athens, but it is no doubt a bittersweet goodbye.  I love Columbus.  I love Akron.  I love where I am no matter where I am.

I most certainly attribute that to the people, but I'd also chalk it up to contentment.  I could very easily sulk through my days missing my family and my friends in other cities.  I could wallow in pity and loneliness, missing those I’ve left behind (for now), or I could be content where I am.

Sure, I miss my home and my friends there (and my church there, my family there, my neighborhood there—you get the idea).  Sure, I miss my compadres in Columbus and all that I left there.  Unfortunately, missing those things doesn’t change anything about my circumstances.

**You have to be thankful for what you have wherever you are**.  Much to my chagrin, I can’t take my favorite people with me to every city.  I’d love to, honestly, but until all of you agree to uproot and move around the state about three times a year, you’ll have to settle for “Wish you were here!” e-cards.

Even if my surroundings are always changing, I’m grateful for them.  I might not always have my best friend, or be able to order my favorite pizza, or get the chance to spend time in a big city, but I know I have a God who will provide **no matter where I am**.  Paul says in Philippians 4,

> “&#8230;<sup>11</sup>I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. <sup>12</sup>I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. <sup>13</sup>I can do everything through him who gives me strength.

Christians are quick to quote the latter part of that verse and forget why Paul says it.  It’s because he has learned to be content.  He knows that no matter what, God is going to work in and through him—whether he is hungry or full (or fill in the blank for your location or situation).

Be content.  Love where you are, and be confident that your situation is exactly what you need.  Whether you know it or not, you’re there for a reason.
