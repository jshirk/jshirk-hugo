What if you could write emails faster, format them easily, include links without hassle and build lists without worrying about the proper bullets or numbering?

It’d be awesome right? Enter Markdown.

Markdown is a simple, lightweight-coding language that makes publishing blogs, crafting emails and even writing books incredibly easy. No more arm wrestling Microsoft Word into doing what you want.

Here’s the gist of Markdown commands.

## Markdown Shortcuts

One asterisk touching each side of text makes something _italic_. This would be \*italic\*.

Two asterisks touching each side of text makes it **bold**. This would be \*\*bold\*\*.

Using a brackets around text followed by parentheses with a link between makes a link [clickable](http://unpacked.co). \[footnote]Be sure to start links with http:// so that the browser understands to open a new web page[/footnote] This would be [clickable\](http://unpacked.co)

Using the pound sign # (or the hashtag) corresponds to the heading levels in HTML. One # makes it H1, or the largest text, all the way down to six #’s strung together making the smallest heading text of H6. No need to get confused on that, just know 1 # = big, 6 # = small. These are best used as section headings, and I use H2 for most section headings, H3 for slightly less important headings and H6 for photo credits. [footnote]I shun H1, H4 and H5 because I just don’t need them.[/footnote]

Like this: #This is H1

An asterisk * at the beginning of a line followed by a space starts a bulletted list.

* This would create a bulleted list  
* This would be the second item in that list

A number with a period at the beginning of a line starts a numbered list. You can move the numbers around or even use 1. for every number, but when you convert it from Markdown to HTML, it will properly number things no matter what Frankenstein order you created. No more worries about missing a number or getting them out of order.

1. This creates a numbered list  
1. When using Markdown the numbers don't matter  
1. It's smart enough to figure it out and order it properly  
1. I left it this way to show you that using all 1's would turn it to the correct number, but it's displaying as all 1's because I don't have Markdown enabled

That’s about it–six commands to use 90% of what is possible with Markdown. It’s amazingly simple, saves you a ton of time and hassle, and makes it almost seem like you know what writing code means. Here’s another quick overview on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

**Just remember that the spaces matter: for headings (#), links [](), italics \*, and bold \*\*, the Markdown commands should touch the letters and each other. For lists, there needs to be a space after the number with a period (1.) or the asterisk \* for bulleted lists.**

What’s great about Markdown that you can copy this into any blog-publishing platform as HTML (the language that makes up the base of most websites) or as straight Markdown if your platform enables it.

Here’s another neat thing Markdown fixes. You know when you see an email and the formatting is all kinds of crazy–you can tell people were just copying and pasting their faces off? Well since Markdown is written without actual formatting, no one will ever know you’ve been Control-C / Control-V’ing your heart out, sending the same essential message to lots of people with minor tweaks.

Markdown can take your blogging and email writing game to the next level, and you’re going to love how easy it is.

## Two Recommendations for Apps That Love Markdown

The main thing you need to use Markdown effectively is a text editor [footnote]That is just a lightweight word processor without all the unnecessary bells and whistles[/footnote] that enables markdown (my current favorite is [Byword](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12&at=11l4uN).

Byword is spectacular because it uses keyboard commands like

  * Command-K to insert a link
  * Command-B to bold
  * Command-I to italicize

and adds the proper Markdown syntax for you. Not only that, you can preview your document that you wrote in Byword to make sure it looks perfect, and it has syntax highlighting to make sure you’re doing everything properly.

For emailing on the Mac, I recommend using [AirMail](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/airmail/id573171375?mt=12&at=11l4uN) because with the click of one button you can enable Markdown support and write your whole email in Markdown right there. Or you can write your email in Markdown with Byword and just copy and paste it straight into AirMail. Voila!
