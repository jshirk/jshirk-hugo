Seventeen months after a shredded ACL. Thirteen months after reconstructive surgery. One and a half days away from a marathon.

I'm anxious. I'm nervous. I'm worried ([against my own sound advice](https://jshirk.com/blog/2010/01/worry-wont-work/)). I'm afraid I won't finish. I'm scared my legs will give out, I'll fall on my face, someone will roll me out of the running lane, and I'll crawl home.

  <p>
    And yet, at the same time, I'm confident that I've prepared mentally and physically. I know it will be the most challenging bodily endeavor I've ever attempted. I know that I've got the support of friends and family and thousands of unknown onlookers rooting for me. And most importantly, I know I've prayed about a million times that I cross the finish line alive&#8211;I'm not doing this alone.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I'm not letting my surgically repaired knee, my doubts, or my ridiculous fears keep me from the 26.2 miles from start to finish.

    What's the lesson from all of this? <strong>It's don't.</strong>
  </p>
  
  <div>
    Don't let anything keep you from challenging yourself.<br /> Don't let anyone tell you you can't do something.<br /> Don't let the thought that you have to be born an athlete to be one, born a genius to think, or born into wealth to have opportunities cloud your view.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Don't let the fleeting time you have on earth become saturated with the status quo.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Don't let me tell you what you're capable of; push yourself, and <strong>erase more don'ts.</strong>
  </div>
