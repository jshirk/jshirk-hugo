It's nearly a daily occurrence for me to throw up a half-hearted-mid-chew prayer to God as I eagerly dive into a bowl of _Reese's Puffs_.

It's more than a rushed supplication. **It's an indicator of a deeper issue.**

**I'm impatient.** I'm too impatient to take a half a minute to thank God for his provision. I'm too impatient to consistently and continually seek God in prayer. I'm too impatient to ignore a phone call or text or tweet, so instead I choose to interrupt a conversation with a real, live human being that I'm talking to face-to-face. I'm too impatient to sit down for 20 minutes and write a single blog post in one sitting (this line is being added in during round three). And I'm certainly _far_ too impatient to deal with customer service over the phone.

**It's hard to be patient** (mostly because of the whole waiting thing).

**As a result of a constantly connected world, I'm in the habit of constantly disconnecting from God.** It's rare for me to make it much longer than a few moments in the awareness of God's presence.

**I'm impatient because I think the next item will satisfy me more than my current situation.**

I think _Reese's Puffs_ are more satisfying then a moment thanking the God of the universe for providing for me.  
I think a tweet or text or call is more satisfying than genuine human connection.  
I think something I can buy is more satisfying than Jesus, who has given himself to me freely.

**Let's not let the next moment get in the way of the current one, especially if the current one is with the Lord.**
