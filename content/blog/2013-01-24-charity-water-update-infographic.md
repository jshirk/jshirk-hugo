I was recently reminded what a blessing it is when you take an opportunity to change lives.

In 2010, I traded my birthday for a chance to build a clean-water well. I created a [charity: water campaign](http://mycharitywater.org/jshirk) to raise $5,000 and thanks to the generosity of many, over $5,000 was raised and a total of 3 wells were built with funds from my campaign and a few others.

Here are a few exciting facts about the projects:

  * **Location:** two wells in Malawi and one in Ethiopia

  * **People:** 546 people served in Africa

  * **Raised:** $5,004 from my project.

  * **Funding Breakdown:** 
      * $2,828.17 went to the [Adi Arbea Village](http://mycharitywater.org/p/myprojectsview?project_id=ET.GOH.Q1.11.083.584&campaign_id=9821) in northern Ethiopia helping 350 people.
      * $2,063.24 with an additional $852.21 coming from the Causing Life by Catherine Holloway campaign went to the [Kamputeni Village](http://mycharitywater.org/p/myprojectsview?project_id=MW.PAI.Q1.11.084.043&campaign_id=9821) in western Malawi serving 39 people as a hand-dug well.
      * $112.59 went to the [Kamtambo Village](http://mycharitywater.org/p/myprojectsview?project_id=MW.PAI.Q1.11.084.113&campaign_id=9821), also a hand-dug well in western Malawi, with $470.50 from Dirk Maas' campaign and $2,332.36 from Tim & Maureen's 30th birthday party campaign.<!--more-->

  * **Giving:** 
      * 115 different individuals/families gave.
      * 13 donations of $100 or more.
      * 6 donations over $200
      * 9 anonymous donations
      * Median donation amount: $40.68
      * Mean: $22
      * Mode: $22
      * 83 donations for $22

Originally we hoped to help 250 people with $5,000. Actually, we helped 546 people (in combination with others) through $8,546.48

Honestly, I hadn't thought much about the project until I received an email with project updates.

It's easy to forget what an impact we can make when we put our heads down and forget to look up.

I didn't do this on my own. It didn't happen because I'm special. In fact, I didn't fulfill my end of the bargain: I wasn't able to run the marathon [insert excuses that don't matter here]. I hope to run two half-marathons in the future to make up for the full marathon. Exhibit A of where I fall short.

Nonetheless, thanks to the grace of God, lives were still changed, people contributed to something that saved lives, and we all got to be a part of something really special.
