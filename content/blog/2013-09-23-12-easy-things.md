Sometimes, at the end of the day, I wonder to myself, _“Have I done anything that really matters today?”_ Honestly, the answer, at least to me, feels like &#8220;No!&#8221; on some days. So I decided to come up with a list of things that _do_ matter and that make a difference in your life and the lives of others.

## Encourage

Text, call, tweet or message to someone you know. Let them know you care about them and you're praying for them. Be specific and use their name.<!--more-->

## Pray

Pray specifically, pray regularly, pray fervently for whatever they are facing. Pray for change instead of telling them to change. Pray that God would draw near to them.

## Give a gift

It doesn't have to be expensive. In fact, it's _better_ if you made it yourself. Design something, make a craft, put together your favorite recipes, bake a (few) dozen cookies. Just experience the blessing of giving.

## Sacrifice a want for someone else's need

Skip the movie theatre and watch a movie you already have on DVD and use the money to give to a charity or someone you know that is struggling financially. Give up a pleasure or a luxury, even if it is temporary, to be a blessing to someone else.

## Send a handwritten note

Buy a box of blank notes for $5, snag some stamps and keep them handy. Send at least one a week. Write to say thanks for little things or to let people them know you're praying for them. Nothing beats a card in the mail. It's amazing.

## Spend time with a friend or family member

Go to a park. Ask real questions about how they're doing, what's been bothering them, how you could help them, if there's anything they just want to get off their chest. Don't do something expensive, just be together.

## Pray _with_ someone

A stranger, a neighbor, a friend. Someone who seems down or anxious or tired. It's crazy that even the least spiritual of people rarely reject an offer to pray for them.

## Do something you've been putting off

Declutter your house and give clothes away. Make that tough phone call. Finish the work project no one else wants to do. Commit in your mind that you're going to do whatever you need to to cross that thing off the list.

## Volunteer

Give your time to help your church, the homeless, or at-risk kids. Sign-up to sell tickets at the local high school football game. Be a part of your community so that one day when you're gone, you've left a gap for someone else to fill.

## Exercise

Take care of yourself to continue doing things for others for a longer period of time. Go on a long run and just think and pray and unwind.

## Write in a journal

And make sure your family gets it down the road so they can continue to learn about you even after you're gone.

## Ask someone, &#8220;what can I do for you today?&#8221;

This is one of my favorite questions to ask (and be asked). People can always use help with _something_ but you'll probably have to dig it out, of them because its such an unusual request. So dig.

## Question: What will you do today to make a difference in someone's life?
