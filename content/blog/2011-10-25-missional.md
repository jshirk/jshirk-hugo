Isn't it funny how those who clean houses for a living have dirty homes? Or how repairmen have all kinds of broken things around the house?

It seems backwards, but I'm an offender myself. **I'm a missionary who isn't missional.**

Talking with college students about Jesus is my day job, and I've recently realized I have a tendency to leave my work on campus. I have a heart to reach Ohio University for Jesus, but I've managed to forget my duty to share my faith outside of my vocation.

All of my coworkers are Christians. Most of my friends still in Athens are Christians. I don't have classes to attend with non-Christians, and I've graduated beyond student organizations where many of my friends didn't know Jesus. I've allowed myself to become trapped inside a Christian bubble.

When we first come to know Jesus, we often have only a few Christian friends and many who don't know the Lord. Then, as we grow in our faith, get plugged into a church and Christian community, our friendship pendulum swings in the opposite direction, and we end up having nearly all Christian friends and only a few friends who don't follow Christ.

[Jesus ate at the table](http://www.esvbible.org/Matthew+9.9-13/) with those who didn't know God. We're called to do the same thing. We're on this earth because God has given us [a mission](http://www.esvbible.org/search/Matthew+28%3A16-20/): to go to the ends of the earth to tell people about Jesus.

It's time for me to start inviting people to my table who don't know Jesus. I want to live life with them, share my faith with them, and love them right where they are. **I want to be missional in my life, not just in my day job.** I want to go into the community, meet new people and tell them about how God has transformed my life.

**Christians, no matter what your day job is, you're called to make disciples and be missional.** Jesus has given us the words of eternal life. We've got to give people and opportunity to respond to them.

If you're a Christian, will you open up your table? Will you be missional wherever God has you?
