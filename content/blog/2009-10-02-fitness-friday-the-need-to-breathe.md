After a brief hiatus, Fitness Friday is back, and it couldn’t be at a more fitting time.  I needed a break for the last few Fridays.  I needed to take a breath, rest, and enjoy some time away from the blogosphere at the week’s end.

In other news, I’ve had to take it easy in my marathon training.  I’ve been hitting the pavement pretty hard, and I tweaked my ankle, which sidelined me for a few days.  My running around, in a literal and figurative sense, was slowed just a bit the last few weeks.  And you know what?  It felt great.

**It’s easy to get caught up in the day in and day out and not stop to breathe.** We run through life without looking back, without taking a break, refusing to stop and reflect&#8211;slowly but surely running ourselves into the ground.

Rest is important.  It’s critical to your progress in training and in life.  You need some time to recharge your batteries.  You’ve got to stop running long enough to make sure you’ve got enough left in the tank to finish the trip (and to make sure you're still headed in the right direction).  **If you don’t refuel, you’ll be halfway through your journey and end up stranded when you run out of steam.**

Take time to breathe.  Take a break.  Take a time out.  Put things on hold.  Your work will be there when you get back.  It’s not easy to stop (even if it's only for a second) when it feels like you’ve got too much to do, but I promise you, relaxing is one of the best things you can do when things are overwhelming.  Just breathe.

**Even God took a day off when he created the universe.** I’d say if the Creator took a break, it’s probably a good idea if we do to.
