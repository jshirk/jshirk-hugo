Iâ€™d be remiss if I didn't share a few of my favorite tools that help me think, work, and act more decisively. Some of them have affiliate links which provide a small kickback to me when you use my link to sign up.

### Finances

- [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/referral?ref=hjtGScdNtYEwmP9n) My go-to app for all my budget-related needs. Signup using this link and get your first 34 days free.
- [Charles Schwab Bank](https://www.schwab.com/client-referral?refrid=REFERFF8CP) I can't sing the praises of this bank enough. Free ATM withdrawals plus reimbursement of any fees worldwide, tremendous customer support, and absolutely no hassle.
- [N26](https://n26.com/r/jordans2045) One of the best (and one of the only free!) banks in Europe. Great app with all the security and convience features yo ucould want.
